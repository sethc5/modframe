# Think Tank Funding Transparency Gaps

Purpose: This module maps how think tanks function as credibility-laundering mechanisms for donor-funded policy preferences, analyzing the gap between their public reputation for independence and their structural dependence on undisclosed funding sources.

Tags: mechanics, institutions, accountability, think-tanks, funding, transparency, policy-research, lobbying

## Key actors
- Think tank leadership and scholars
- Corporate donors (industry-aligned research funding)
- Foreign governments (FARA-adjacent influence channel)
- Ideological foundations (Koch, Soros, etc.)
- Congressional staff and members (research consumers)
- Media (expert citation without funding disclosure)
- IRS (501(c)(3) oversight, Form 990)

## Case study
- **Foreign government funding of U.S. think tanks**: The 2014 New York Times investigation revealed that foreign governments were funding major think tanks to produce research aligned with the donor government's policy preferences, often without congressional testimony disclosure.

## Data sources
- Transparify think tank transparency ratings
- IRS Form 990 filings for major think tanks
- Congressional testimony records (funding disclosure analysis)
- OpenSecrets think tank and nonprofit political spending data
