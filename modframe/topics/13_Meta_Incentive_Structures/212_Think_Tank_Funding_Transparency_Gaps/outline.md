# Think Tank Funding Transparency Gaps

**Summary:** Think tanks occupy a unique position in the policy ecosystem as ostensibly independent research organizations that produce analysis consumed by legislators, regulators, and media — but their funding sources are often opaque, creating a channel through which corporate, foreign government, and ideological donor interests can shape policy research without public attribution. [Observed] Most major think tanks are organized as 501(c)(3) nonprofits and are not required to publicly disclose their donors; some voluntarily publish donor lists but rarely disclose the amounts or conditions attached to funding. [Observed] The structural incentive is that think tanks depend on continued donor funding for institutional survival, creating pressure to produce research that aligns with funder interests — not through explicit editorial control (which would undermine credibility) but through selection effects: donors fund institutions whose existing analytical orientation produces conclusions favorable to the donor's interests. [Inferred] The result is a policy research ecosystem where the intellectual independence of the analysis and the financial independence of the institution are structurally decoupled, but the public and policymakers treat think tank output as if both forms of independence exist simultaneously. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Think tanks produce policy research funded by donors whose identities and interests are not systematically disclosed, creating an information channel where the research appears independent but the institutional incentives favor alignment with funder preferences. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Think tank leadership and scholars** — design research agendas, produce policy papers, and testify before Congress; maintain institutional reputation for analytical independence. [Observed] Incentive: produce credible research that attracts both attention and funding. Constraint: must balance donor preferences with analytical credibility; overly partisan or results-driven research degrades institutional reputation. [Inferred]
- **Corporate donors** — fund think tank programs that produce research in their regulatory or legislative areas of interest; gain access to policymakers through think tank convenings and events. [Observed] Incentive: shape the intellectual environment in which policy decisions about their industry are made. [Inferred]
- **Foreign governments** — fund think tank programs focused on international relations, trade, and security policy; gain a channel for influencing U.S. policy debate without registering under FARA. [Observed — source: NYT investigation, 2014]
- **Ideological foundations** — provide unrestricted or program-specific funding that sustains think tanks oriented toward particular ideological positions (e.g., Koch network, Soros-funded organizations). [Observed]
- **Congressional staff and members** — consume think tank research as policy input; cite think tank studies in hearings, floor statements, and bill justifications. [Observed] Constraint: limited tools to evaluate whether cited research reflects donor influence. [Inferred]
- **Media** — cite think tank scholars as experts without systematically disclosing the institution's funding sources. [Observed]
- **IRS** — grants 501(c)(3) status to think tanks; requires Form 990 filing (which discloses finances but not individual donor identities). [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A think tank identifies a policy area for research based on a combination of institutional mission, available funding, and scholarly interest. [Observed]
- Donors (corporate, foundation, foreign government, individual) provide funding — either unrestricted or earmarked for specific research programs. [Observed]
- Think tank scholars conduct research and produce policy papers, reports, and testimony that enters the policy debate through congressional hearings, media citations, and direct briefings to policymakers. [Observed]
- Policymakers consume think tank output as independent expert analysis; the funding source behind the research is typically not disclosed in the research product itself. [Observed]
- Think tank scholars testify before Congress, where they are introduced by institutional affiliation but not by funding source; congressional rules require disclosure of foreign government funding but enforcement is inconsistent. [Observed]
- Media cite think tank scholars as independent experts; funding disclosure in media coverage is rare and inconsistent. [Observed]
- Donors evaluate whether the think tank's output aligns with their interests and adjust future funding accordingly, creating a feedback loop that rewards alignment without requiring explicit editorial direction. [Inferred]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Think tank leadership controls research agenda selection, creating the first filter through which donor influence operates — not by directing conclusions but by determining which questions are asked. [Inferred]
- **Bottlenecks:** Congressional testimony slots are limited; think tanks with the strongest reputations and largest donor bases secure disproportionate access, amplifying their funders' policy preferences. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Donors can withdraw funding from think tanks whose research diverges from donor interests, creating a market discipline that operates through institutional survival incentives. [Inferred]

### Common failure modes

- Selection effects: donors fund think tanks whose pre-existing analytical orientation produces favorable conclusions, making it unnecessary to exercise direct editorial control — the bias is built into the funding decision. [Inferred]
- Foreign government funding of U.S. think tanks creates a policy influence channel that bypasses FARA registration requirements, since think tanks are not themselves lobbying but producing research that supports the foreign government's preferred policy positions. [Observed]
- Revolving door between think tanks and government: scholars move into government positions and then back to think tanks, creating a career pathway where think tank funding shapes the intellectual frameworks of future policymakers. [Observed]
- Voluntary disclosure standards vary dramatically: some think tanks publish donor lists (without amounts), others disclose nothing; no mandatory standard exists. [Observed]
- Corporate-funded policy research enters the public debate as independent analysis, obscuring the financial interest behind the conclusions. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze think tank research output and compare policy conclusions to known donor interests to test for systematic alignment. [Inferred]
- Track think tank scholar movement into government positions and analyze whether their policy positions in government reflect their think tank's funder interests. [Hypothesis]
- Compare funding disclosure practices across the top 50 think tanks to map the transparency spectrum. [Observed]
- Identify cases where think tank research conclusions shifted after major donor changes to test the donor-influence hypothesis. [Hypothesis]
- Analyze congressional testimony by think tank scholars and measure the frequency of funding source disclosure. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the think tank funding architecture — 501(c)(3) status, donor categories, disclosure practices, and the research-to-policy pipeline. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain how selection effects and institutional survival incentives create donor-aligned research without requiring explicit editorial control. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific case where think tank research output aligned with major donor interests and was cited in congressional or regulatory proceedings. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present transparency ratings, donor overlap with research topics, congressional testimony data, and revolving door patterns between think tanks and government. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate mandatory donor disclosure for policy-focused nonprofits, congressional testimony funding disclosure rules, enhanced FARA requirements for foreign-funded research, and transparency standards for media citations. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Think tanks function as a credibility laundering mechanism where donor-funded policy preferences are repackaged as independent expert analysis and injected into the policy debate without source attribution. [Inferred]
