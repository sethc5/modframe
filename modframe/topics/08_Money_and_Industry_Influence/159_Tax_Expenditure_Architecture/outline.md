# Tax Expenditure Architecture

**Summary:** Tax expenditures — revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that allow special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential rates, or deferrals of tax liability — represent over $1.8 trillion annually in forgone federal revenue (FY 2024 estimate), exceeding total discretionary spending. [Observed] Unlike direct spending programs, tax expenditures are enacted through amendments to the tax code, are not subject to annual appropriations, do not expire unless Congress includes sunset provisions, and receive minimal ongoing oversight or performance evaluation. [Observed] This structural difference means that tax expenditures function as a parallel spending system that delivers benefits to specific industries, income groups, and activities through the tax code rather than through direct appropriations, largely invisible to standard budget oversight. [Inferred] The largest tax expenditures — employer-provided health insurance exclusion (~$300B/yr), mortgage interest deduction (~$30B/yr), preferential rates for capital gains and dividends (~$200B/yr), retirement savings deferrals (~$275B/yr), and pass-through business deductions (§199A, ~$60B/yr) — disproportionately benefit higher-income taxpayers and specific industries, making the tax expenditure system a major but under-scrutinized driver of economic inequality.

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Tax expenditures deliver over $1.8 trillion annually in implicit federal subsidies through the tax code, bypassing the appropriations process, annual oversight, and performance evaluation that apply to equivalent direct spending programs. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **House Ways and Means Committee** — originating jurisdiction for all tax legislation under Article I, § 7 of the Constitution; controls the design, scope, and sunset provisions of tax expenditures. [Observed] Incentive: members receive among the highest campaign contributions in Congress, heavily from industries seeking tax preferences. [Observed — source: OpenSecrets.org committee contribution data]
- **Senate Finance Committee** — shares jurisdiction over tax legislation with Ways and Means; must pass its own version of tax bills, creating a two-committee process. [Observed] Incentive: same contribution dynamics as Ways and Means. [Observed]
- **Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)** — nonpartisan congressional committee that provides revenue estimates ("scores") for proposed tax legislation, including the cost of tax expenditures; JCT scores are determinative for whether tax provisions comply with budget rules. [Observed] Incentive: produce accurate, nonpartisan analysis. Constraint: JCT's conventional revenue estimation methodology does not account for behavioral responses or economic growth effects, creating persistent tension with proponents of "dynamic scoring." [Observed — source: 26 U.S.C. § 8001-8023]
- **Department of the Treasury / Office of Tax Policy** — develops the administration's tax policy proposals, drafts technical legislative language, and publishes the annual Tax Expenditure Budget as part of the President's Budget. [Observed] Incentive: advance the administration's tax policy agenda. Constraint: technical expertise gives Treasury significant influence over legislative language but not over final policy choices. [Observed]
- **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** — administers tax expenditures through the filing and audit process; determines taxpayer eligibility for credits, deductions, and exclusions. [Observed] Incentive: ensure compliance. Constraint: IRS enforcement capacity has declined relative to the complexity of the tax code, reducing audit rates for provisions most subject to abuse. [Observed]
- **Tax lobbying industry** — tax-focused lobbying firms, the Tax Foundation, the National Federation of Independent Business, industry-specific associations (National Association of Realtors for mortgage interest deduction, investment industry for capital gains rates), and accounting/law firms generate significant revenue from helping clients secure and preserve tax preferences. [Observed] Incentive: sustain complexity and preferential provisions that generate advisory and compliance revenue. [Inferred]
- **Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and OMB** — produce competing tax expenditure estimates using different baseline assumptions (CBO uses a "normal tax" baseline; Treasury uses a "reference tax law" baseline), which can yield substantially different estimates for the same provision. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- Tax expenditures are created through amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, typically as part of major tax legislation (e.g., Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) but also through standalone bills and legislative riders. [Observed]
- The legislative process follows the standard path: committee markup in Ways and Means and Finance, floor votes, conference, and presidential signature. [Observed] However, tax legislation is frequently fast-tracked through budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority in the Senate and limits debate, bypassing the filibuster. [Observed]
- JCT scores proposed provisions; for provisions that lose revenue, proponents must identify offsets or accept the cost within reconciliation instructions. [Observed] Proponents invest significant effort in designing provisions to minimize JCT scores (e.g., sunset provisions that technically reduce the 10-year cost window, phase-ins, income limitations that will affect relatively few taxpayers). [Observed]
- Once enacted, tax expenditures are self-executing through the filing process: taxpayers claim the benefit on their returns, and IRS administers eligibility through audit and guidance. [Observed] No annual renewal is required unless a sunset provision was included. [Observed]
- Treasury's Office of Tax Policy issues regulations and guidance interpreting enacted provisions; these interpretive decisions often have enormous fiscal impact (e.g., Treasury regulations defining "qualified business income" for §199A shaped a $60B/yr provision's effective scope). [Observed]
- Tax expenditures without sunset provisions continue indefinitely; there is no equivalent of the appropriations process to reevaluate them annually. [Observed] Provisions that do sunset (like the individual provisions of the 2017 TCJA, set to expire in 2025) create periodic legislative moments for renewal, expansion, or reform. [Observed]
- JCT and Treasury publish annual tax expenditure estimates, but these receive minimal congressional attention; there is no regular committee hearing process systematically reviewing the performance or cost-effectiveness of existing tax expenditures. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Ways and Means Committee chair and Finance Committee chair control which tax provisions reach the floor; their mark-up decisions determine which industries receive tax preferences. [Observed] JCT staff determine revenue scores that are practically binding on legislative feasibility. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Budget reconciliation rules (Byrd Rule, 2 U.S.C. § 644) constrain what can be included in tax legislation passed through reconciliation; the Senate Parliamentarian's interpretation of these rules determines which tax provisions qualify. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** The President can veto tax legislation (but has limited item-veto power — no line-item veto for specific provisions). [Observed] Treasury's interpretive regulations can significantly narrow or expand the effective scope of enacted provisions without additional legislation. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- **Upside-down subsidies:** Most tax deductions and exclusions are worth more to higher-income taxpayers (who face higher marginal rates), creating a regressive subsidy structure where the wealthiest receive the largest benefit from provisions nominally designed to encourage broadly beneficial activities (homeownership, retirement saving, health insurance). [Observed]
- **Complexity as durability:** The tax code's complexity makes individual provisions difficult for the public and non-specialist legislators to understand, insulating tax expenditures from the scrutiny that equivalent direct spending programs would receive. [Inferred]
- **Sunset gaming:** Congress includes sunset provisions to reduce 10-year cost estimates (making provisions score-compliant within reconciliation), with the expectation that provisions will be renewed before expiration — creating artificial legislative urgency that favors extension over evaluation. [Observed]
- **Invisible spending:** Tax expenditures do not appear in appropriations bills and are not counted as "spending" in headline budget figures, making them politically easier to create and maintain than equivalent direct spending programs. [Observed]
- **Audit gap:** IRS resource limitations reduce audit rates for complex provisions most subject to aggressive interpretation, effectively delegating enforcement to taxpayer self-reporting with minimal verification. [Observed — source: IRS Data Book; TIGTA reports]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare the distributional impact of major tax expenditures by income quintile with equivalent direct spending programs to test the "upside-down subsidy" thesis. [Observed — source: JCT distributional analysis, CBO "Distribution of Major Tax Expenditures"]
- Track tax expenditure creation, modification, and elimination rates over time to test the durability thesis. [Inferred — source: JCT annual estimates, CRS reports]
- Analyze campaign contributions to Ways and Means and Finance Committee members from industries benefiting from specific tax expenditures. [Observed — source: FEC data, OpenSecrets.org]
- Compare IRS audit rates for returns claiming complex tax expenditures with audit rates for simpler returns. [Observed — source: IRS Data Book]
- Evaluate whether sunset provisions produce meaningful legislative review or automatic extension. [Observed — source: legislative history of expiring provisions]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the tax expenditure system — how provisions are created through the tax code rather than appropriations, how they are scored by JCT, how they are administered by IRS, and how they differ structurally from direct spending (no annual renewal, no performance evaluation, no appropriations oversight). [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why tax expenditures are the preferred tool for delivering subsidies: they are politically easier to enact ("tax cuts" vs. "new spending"), invisible in headline budget figures, durable without annual renewal, and generate lobbying relationships with the two most contribution-heavy committees in Congress. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace the §199A qualified business income deduction (created by TCJA 2017, estimated at ~$60B/yr) from its legislative origins (late-stage addition to match the corporate rate cut with a pass-through benefit), through Treasury's consequential interpretive regulations, to its distributional impact (heavily concentrated among high-income business owners). [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present the JCT's top 20 tax expenditures by cost, distributional analysis showing how benefits scale with income, comparison of tax expenditure total ($1.8T) with total discretionary spending (~$1.7T), and creation/elimination rates for tax provisions over time. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate converting tax expenditures to direct spending (appropriations-based) equivalents; replacing deductions with fixed-dollar credits (eliminating the upside-down subsidy effect); mandatory sunset provisions with performance review requirements; establishing a Tax Expenditure Review Board (analogous to BRAC); and requiring JCT distributional analysis for all tax expenditure proposals. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Tax expenditures represent the federal government's largest and least scrutinized spending channel — a parallel budget that delivers over $1.8 trillion annually in implicit subsidies through the tax code, largely invisible to public oversight, structurally regressive, and protected by the political dynamics that make "tax cuts" permanently easier to enact and maintain than equivalent direct spending. [Inferred]
