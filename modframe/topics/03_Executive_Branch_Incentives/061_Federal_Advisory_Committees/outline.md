# Federal Advisory Committees

**Summary:** Federal advisory committees are groups established to provide advice to the executive branch on policy, scientific, technical, and administrative matters, governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 which imposes transparency and balance requirements. This matters because advisory committees shape agency decisions by providing expert recommendations, but committee composition, charter design, and staff influence over agendas determine whether advisory input reflects independent expertise or pre-determined policy preferences. FACA's requirements — balanced membership, open meetings, public access to materials — create accountability structures, but compliance is uneven and agencies retain significant discretion over which recommendations to adopt or ignore. Advisory committees function as legitimation devices that can either enhance or obscure the basis for agency decisions. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Federal advisory committees provide structured expert input under FACA transparency requirements, but agency control over composition, agendas, and adoption determines whether advice enhances or legitimates decisions. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- The president and agency heads establish advisory committees by executive order, statute, or agency authority, defining their scope, membership, and duration through charter documents. [Observed]
- The General Services Administration Committee Management Secretariat oversees government-wide FACA compliance, maintains the advisory committee database, and issues guidance on committee operations. [Observed]
- Designated Federal Officers manage individual committees, set meeting agendas, approve attendee lists, and control document flow between committees and agency leadership. [Observed]
- Committee members (appointed experts, stakeholder representatives, and public interest members) deliberate, develop recommendations, and publish reports within their chartered mandate. [Observed]
- Congressional oversight committees review FACA compliance, question committee composition balance, and examine whether agency decisions align with or ignore advisory recommendations. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- An agency identifies an advisory need and files a charter with GSA specifying the committee's purpose, membership composition, meeting schedule, and termination date. [Observed]
- The agency appoints members, balancing expertise, stakeholder representation, and demographic diversity as required by FACA and agency policy. [Observed]
- The Designated Federal Officer convenes meetings, ensures public notice and access, manages deliberations, and oversees preparation of meeting minutes and recommendations. [Observed]
- The committee develops recommendations through deliberation, drafts reports, and transmits findings to the agency head or designated recipient. [Observed]
- The agency reviews recommendations and decides whether to adopt, modify, or reject them; FACA does not require agencies to follow advisory committee advice. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Designated Federal Officers control meeting agendas, member access, and document flow, giving agency staff significant influence over committee deliberation scope and direction. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Membership appointment decisions determine committee balance and perspective diversity, and appointing authorities can stack committees to produce preferred recommendations. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Agencies retain full discretion over whether to adopt committee recommendations, making advisory output influential but non-binding. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Committee stacking through biased appointments produces recommendations that reflect appointing authority preferences rather than independent expert consensus. [Observed]
- DFO agenda control can limit deliberation scope, preventing committees from addressing issues inconvenient to the sponsoring agency. [Inferred]
- FACA compliance avoidance through informal advisory arrangements (e.g., "subcommittees" or "working groups" not chartered under FACA) reduces transparency. [Observed]
- Committee renewal without purpose reassessment allows obsolete committees to persist, consuming administrative resources without producing useful advice. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Track committee membership composition against FACA balance requirements to identify systematic bias patterns across agencies or administrations. [Observed]
- Compare advisory committee recommendations with subsequent agency decisions to measure adoption rates and identify selective implementation patterns. [Observed]
- Audit DFO practices to determine whether agenda control, meeting scheduling, and document management influence deliberation outcomes. [Inferred]
- Evaluate whether enhanced FACA enforcement, independent membership selection, or mandatory response requirements would strengthen advisory committee independence. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Explain the FACA framework, charter process, membership requirements, DFO role, meeting transparency rules, and the advisory-to-decision pipeline. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show why agencies use advisory committees for legitimation, why membership stacking occurs, and why DFO agenda control shapes deliberation outcomes. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace an advisory committee from establishment through membership selection, deliberation, recommendation, and agency response to illustrate how structural choices shape advisory independence. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use FACA database records, membership balance analysis, and recommendation adoption rates to test advisory independence claims. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Assess reforms including independent membership panels, mandatory agency response to recommendations, and enhanced FACA coverage for informal advisory arrangements. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Federal advisory committees can enhance or undermine decision quality depending on whether composition, agenda control, and adoption practices protect independent expertise from agency preference capture. [Inferred]
