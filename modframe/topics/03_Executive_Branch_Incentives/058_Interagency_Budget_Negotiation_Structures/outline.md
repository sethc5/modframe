# Interagency Budget Negotiation Structures

**Summary:** Interagency budget negotiation structures determine how the executive branch resolves competing resource claims among departments and agencies before the president submits a unified budget to Congress. This matters because the internal budget process is where presidential priorities are translated into dollar amounts, and the negotiation structures determine which agencies gain resources, which lose them, and how trade-offs are communicated. OMB resource management offices serve as the central arbiters, conducting passback negotiations with agency budget offices and resolving appeals through the OMB Director and ultimately the president. The process is largely opaque to Congress and the public, concentrating distributive power in OMB staff who control the analytical frameworks and scoring conventions that shape funding outcomes.

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Interagency budget negotiations funnel competing agency resource claims through OMB arbitration, concentrating distributive authority in White House staff who control analytical frameworks and funding trade-off decisions. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- The OMB Director oversees the budget formulation process, resolves major disputes between agencies, and presents the president's budget as a unified executive branch document. [Observed]
- OMB resource management offices (RMOs) analyze agency budget requests, conduct passback negotiations, and make initial funding recommendations that frame subsequent appeals. [Observed]
- Agency budget officers prepare and defend their department's budget submission, negotiate with assigned OMB RMOs, and escalate unresolved disputes to the OMB Director or president. [Observed]
- The president makes final decisions on major budget disputes, sets top-line priorities, and approves the unified budget for submission to Congress. [Observed]
- White House policy councils (Domestic Policy Council, National Security Council, National Economic Council) advocate for policy-aligned funding levels and shape priority-setting during budget formulation. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- OMB issues budget guidance to agencies in the spring, establishing assumptions, ceilings, and priority areas that constrain initial submissions. [Observed]
- Agencies prepare and submit detailed budget requests to OMB by early fall, including justifications, performance data, and multi-year projections. [Observed]
- OMB RMOs review submissions, apply analytical frameworks, and issue passback decisions that represent initial funding recommendations, typically below agency requests. [Observed]
- Agencies appeal passback decisions they consider unacceptable, arguing to RMO directors, the OMB Deputy Director, or the OMB Director depending on dispute magnitude. [Observed]
- Final disputes are elevated to the president for resolution; the president's budget is assembled, reviewed for consistency, and transmitted to Congress in early February. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** OMB RMO analysts control the initial passback framework, and their analytical assumptions and scoring conventions significantly constrain subsequent negotiation outcomes. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** The passback-appeal cycle creates a compressed negotiation window where agencies must respond rapidly, giving OMB structural advantages from information asymmetry and timeline control. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** The president's final decision authority resolves deadlocks but is exercised infrequently, meaning most budget outcomes reflect OMB staff-level judgments rather than direct presidential intervention. [Inferred]

### Common failure modes

- OMB analytical frameworks embed assumptions that systematically advantage or disadvantage certain agencies based on measurement conventions rather than substantive policy judgment. [Inferred]
- Compressed negotiation timelines prevent thorough agency responses to passback decisions, producing suboptimal resource allocation outcomes. [Observed]
- Information asymmetry favors OMB because RMOs review multiple agency budgets simultaneously while each agency sees only its own negotiations. [Observed]
- Cross-cutting priorities that span multiple agencies (e.g., cybersecurity, climate) are difficult to fund coherently when budget negotiations occur in bilateral agency-OMB channels. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare agency budget requests with passback decisions and final budget levels to measure OMB adjustment patterns and identify systematic biases. [Observed]
- Track appeal success rates by agency, program area, and dispute magnitude to test whether the appeals process functions as a meaningful check on RMO discretion. [Inferred]
- Analyze cross-cutting program funding coherence across agencies to test whether bilateral negotiation structures produce coordinated or fragmented resource allocation. [Inferred]
- Evaluate whether alternative budget processes (e.g., portfolio-based budgeting, cross-agency priority accounts) improve allocation quality for multi-agency missions. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Explain the budget formulation calendar, OMB guidance and passback process, agency submission and appeals procedures, and presidential final decision mechanisms. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show why OMB staff accumulate distributive authority and why agencies face structural disadvantages in passback negotiations due to information asymmetry and timeline compression. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a budget negotiation dispute through submission, passback, appeal, and presidential resolution to illustrate power dynamics and outcome determinants. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use budget request-to-final comparisons, appeal outcomes, and cross-agency funding coherence data to test allocation quality claims. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Assess reforms including multi-year budgeting, cross-agency portfolio accounts, transparent passback criteria, and enhanced agency analytical capacity. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Interagency budget negotiations concentrate distributive power in OMB staff because analytical framework control, information asymmetry, and timeline compression give White House budget analysts decisive influence over agency resource levels. [Inferred]
