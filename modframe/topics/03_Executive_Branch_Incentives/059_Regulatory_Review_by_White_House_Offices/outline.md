# Regulatory Review by White House Offices

**Summary:** White House regulatory review, centered in the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB, gives the president centralized control over agency rulemaking by requiring executive branch agencies to submit significant rules for review before publication. This matters because OIRA review functions as a presidential filter on regulatory output, allowing White House policy staff to delay, modify, or block rules that conflict with presidential priorities, even when agencies have statutory mandates to regulate. Additional White House offices including the Domestic Policy Council, National Economic Council, and Office of Science and Technology Policy participate in review, creating multiple advocacy and veto channels. The result is a centralized clearance process that subordinates agency expertise and statutory mandates to presidential political and policy preferences. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** OIRA and White House policy offices review significant agency rules before publication, creating a centralized presidential clearance process that can delay, modify, or block regulatory actions. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- The OIRA Administrator oversees regulatory review, manages the review timeline, coordinates interagency comments, and negotiates rule modifications with agencies. [Observed]
- White House policy councils (DPC, NEC, OSTP) participate in OIRA review by providing policy perspectives and advocating for or against specific rules based on presidential priorities. [Observed]
- Agency rulemaking offices develop proposed and final rules, submit them to OIRA, respond to review comments, and negotiate modifications to obtain clearance. [Observed]
- Regulated industries, advocacy organizations, and other outside stakeholders contact OIRA during review to influence rule outcomes, with all meetings disclosed on the OIRA meeting log. [Observed]
- Congressional committees monitor regulatory review through OIRA reporting requirements and oversight hearings, though their ability to compel timely rule clearance is limited. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- An agency develops a significant rule and submits it to OIRA for review under Executive Order 12866 (as amended), along with a regulatory impact analysis for economically significant rules. [Observed]
- OIRA circulates the rule to relevant White House offices and other agencies for interagency comment, aggregating feedback into a unified review response. [Observed]
- OIRA conducts meetings with external stakeholders who request them, logging all meetings on the public OIRA meeting log. [Observed]
- OIRA negotiates modifications with the agency based on interagency comments, cost-benefit analysis, and presidential policy alignment; rules are cleared, returned for revision, or held without action. [Observed]
- Cleared rules are published in the Federal Register; rules held at OIRA without resolution can remain in review indefinitely, effectively blocking regulatory action without formal denial. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** The OIRA Administrator controls the review timeline and clearance decision, giving a single White House office effective veto power over agency rulemaking output. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** The 90-day review period is frequently extended or reset, and rules held at OIRA without clearance face indefinite delay with no formal mechanism for agencies to force resolution. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** White House policy councils can raise objections during interagency review that OIRA incorporates as negotiation demands, creating multiple informal veto channels beyond OIRA itself. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Extended OIRA review periods function as de facto rule suppression when politically disfavored rules are held without clearance or formal rejection. [Observed]
- Interagency comment processes inject non-expert political objections into technically complex rulemakings, diluting agency expertise in rule design. [Inferred]
- Cost-benefit analysis requirements imposed during OIRA review create analytical burdens that disproportionately affect health, safety, and environmental regulations with diffuse benefits. [Observed]
- OIRA meeting transparency captures only formal logged meetings; informal contacts with White House staff and outside stakeholders may influence outcomes without disclosure. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Track OIRA review durations by agency, rule type, and administration to measure whether review timelines correlate with political preferences rather than analytical complexity. [Observed]
- Compare pre-OIRA and post-OIRA rule text to quantify the scope and direction of modifications imposed during review. [Observed]
- Analyze OIRA meeting log entries by stakeholder type to test whether industry representatives receive disproportionate access relative to public interest organizations. [Observed]
- Evaluate whether alternative review structures (e.g., independent regulatory analysis offices, time-limited review with automatic clearance) would preserve analytical quality while reducing delay. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Explain the OIRA review process, Executive Order 12866 framework, interagency circulation procedures, cost-benefit requirements, and meeting transparency rules. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show why centralized review benefits presidential control and why agencies face structural disadvantages when OIRA delays or demands rule modifications. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a rule through OIRA review, showing how interagency comments, stakeholder meetings, and negotiation modified the final outcome. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use OIRA review duration data, rule modification analysis, and meeting log patterns to test whether review systematically favors certain interests. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Assess reforms including statutory review deadlines with automatic clearance, independent regulatory analysis, and enhanced meeting transparency requirements. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** OIRA regulatory review concentrates rulemaking control in the White House because indefinite delay authority and interagency negotiation leverage allow presidential preferences to override agency expertise and statutory mandates. [Inferred]
