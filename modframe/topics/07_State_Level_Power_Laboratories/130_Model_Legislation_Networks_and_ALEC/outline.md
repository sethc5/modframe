# Model Legislation Networks and ALEC

**Summary:** Model legislation networks—most prominently the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), but also the State Innovation Exchange (SiX), the Council of State Governments, and the National Conference of State Legislatures—draft template bills that are introduced across multiple state legislatures, enabling coordinated policy adoption at scale. ALEC's task-force structure pairs corporate members with state legislators to co-draft model bills on topics from tort reform to energy policy, creating a direct pipeline from industry interests to legislative text. These networks exploit the structural vulnerability of part-time, under-staffed state legislatures that lack independent policy research capacity, making pre-drafted legislation an efficient substitute for original bill drafting. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Model legislation networks supply ready-made bill language to under-resourced state legislatures, enabling coordinated multi-state policy adoption driven by organized interest groups. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- ALEC convenes corporate and legislative members in task forces that co-draft model legislation, providing bill language, talking points, and implementation strategies. [Observed]
- State legislators introduce model bills—often with minimal modification—in their home legislatures, providing the political sponsorship that translates template language into enacted law. [Observed]
- Corporate members fund ALEC operations and participate in task forces, gaining direct influence over legislative language that affects their business interests. [Observed]
- Progressive counterpart organizations (SiX, State Innovation Exchange) develop competing model legislation on labor, environment, and civil-rights issues. [Observed]
- Investigative journalists and transparency organizations (Center for Media and Democracy, Documented) expose model-bill adoption patterns and corporate influence in drafting. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- Task forces composed of legislators and private-sector members identify policy priorities, review research, and draft model legislation with specific statutory language. [Observed]
- Model bills are voted on by task-force members and, if approved, disseminated to ALEC's legislative membership through conferences, publications, and direct outreach. [Observed]
- State legislators customize model bills for local statutory context and introduce them through normal legislative processes, often without disclosing the template origin. [Observed]
- Coordinated introduction across multiple states creates momentum, as passage in early-adopter states provides precedent and political cover for subsequent adoptions. [Observed]
- Opponents track model-bill language through text-comparison tools and public-records requests to identify coordinated campaigns and mobilize counter-strategies. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Task-force leadership determines which policy proposals advance to model-bill status, controlling the pipeline of template legislation available to legislators. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Corporate funding sustains model-legislation operations, creating dependence that aligns organizational priorities with funder interests. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Under-resourced legislative staff and committees lack capacity to independently evaluate model-bill provisions, reducing scrutiny of pre-drafted language. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Model bills designed for national applicability may fit poorly with specific state legal frameworks, creating implementation problems and unintended consequences. [Observed]
- Corporate co-drafting produces legislation that prioritizes industry interests while using public-interest framing, obscuring the distributional effects of enacted bills. [Observed]
- Legislators who introduce model bills without independent analysis may not fully understand the provisions they sponsor, undermining informed deliberation. [Observed]
- Transparency gaps allow model-bill origins to remain hidden from the public, reducing accountability for the interests that shaped legislative language. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Use text-comparison algorithms to match enacted state legislation against known model-bill databases, quantifying adoption rates and modification levels. [Observed]
- Track ALEC corporate membership and task-force participation against the substantive content of model bills to document influence patterns. [Observed]
- Survey state legislators on their awareness of model-bill origins and the extent to which they modify template language before introduction. [Hypothesis]
- Compare policy outcomes in states that adopt model legislation versus those that develop original bills on the same topics. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the organizational architecture of model legislation networks including task forces, membership tiers, funding flows, and dissemination channels. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show how corporate members gain legislative influence, legislators gain policy capacity, and network organizations gain funding through the model-legislation exchange. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific model bill (Stand Your Ground, Right to Work, or voter-ID legislation) from ALEC task-force drafting through multi-state adoption to illustrate the pipeline. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use text-matching databases, corporate-membership records, and legislative adoption timelines to document the scale and speed of model-bill diffusion. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate reforms including model-bill disclosure requirements, gift and travel reporting for legislators, corporate-membership transparency, and legislative staff capacity investment. [Observed]
6. **Takeaway:** Model legislation networks demonstrate how organized interests exploit resource asymmetries in state legislatures to achieve coordinated, large-scale policy adoption through template legislation. [Inferred]
