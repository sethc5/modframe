# State Attorneys General as Policy Entrepreneurs

**Summary:** State attorneys general have evolved from primarily legal advisors into aggressive policy entrepreneurs who use litigation, multistate coalitions, and public advocacy to shape national policy on issues ranging from climate change to technology regulation. The office's unique combination of litigation authority, independent election (in 43 states), and discretion over enforcement priorities allows AGs to pursue policy agendas that may diverge from their state's governor or legislature. Partisan AG coalitions—organized through the Republican and Democratic Attorneys General Associations—coordinate multistate lawsuits that function as a form of policy contestation, using litigation to block, delay, or rewrite federal and corporate policies. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Independently elected state attorneys general leverage litigation authority and multistate coalitions to pursue policy agendas beyond traditional law enforcement. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- State attorneys general exercise independent litigation authority to bring enforcement actions, file multistate suits, and issue advisory opinions that shape state legal policy. [Observed]
- The Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) and Democratic Attorneys General Association (DAGA) coordinate partisan litigation strategies, fundraising, and candidate recruitment. [Observed]
- Private law firms serve as outside counsel on contingency-fee arrangements in complex litigation, aligning private profit incentives with AG enforcement priorities. [Observed]
- Federal agencies and regulated industries respond to AG enforcement actions through negotiation, litigation, and lobbying for federal preemption of state-level enforcement. [Observed]
- Consumer protection and environmental advocacy organizations partner with AGs on investigations and provide technical expertise for complex regulatory enforcement cases. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- AGs identify enforcement priorities based on constituent complaints, advocacy-group referrals, media investigations, and political opportunity. [Observed]
- Lead AGs recruit coalition partners for multistate investigations, sharing litigation costs and leveraging combined jurisdictional authority against national targets. [Observed]
- Investigations proceed through civil investigative demands, subpoenas, depositions, and document production that generate evidence for enforcement actions. [Observed]
- Settlement negotiations produce consent decrees, monetary penalties, and behavioral remedies that impose regulatory standards across multiple jurisdictions. [Observed]
- AG offices publicize enforcement outcomes to build political profiles, deter future violations, and establish precedents for subsequent enforcement actions. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** AGs exercise unreviewable discretion over which cases to pursue, effectively setting enforcement priorities for their states' consumer protection and antitrust laws. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Multistate coalition leadership by a small number of activist AGs determines the national litigation agenda, with other states joining as followers. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** AG litigation can effectively veto federal regulatory policies by securing injunctions from sympathetic courts before policies take effect. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Contingency-fee arrangements with private counsel create principal-agent problems where private attorneys may prioritize fee recovery over public interest objectives. [Observed]
- Partisan coalition litigation can become performative, aimed at political messaging rather than achieving durable legal or regulatory outcomes. [Observed]
- AG enforcement priorities may reflect donor interests rather than constituent needs, particularly when RAGA/DAGA fundraising depends on industry contributions. [Observed]
- Multistate settlements may produce inadequate remedies when AGs prioritize headline settlement amounts over structural behavioral reforms. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Track multistate coalition membership patterns to determine whether AG litigation partnerships correlate with partisan affiliation or substantive policy alignment. [Observed]
- Analyze contingency-fee contracts and outcomes to assess whether private counsel arrangements serve public interests effectively. [Observed]
- Compare AG enforcement outcomes with subsequent corporate behavior changes to measure whether litigation produces durable deterrence. [Hypothesis]
- Map RAGA/DAGA donor networks against AG enforcement priorities to test whether funding sources influence litigation target selection. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the institutional authority of state AG offices including litigation powers, advisory opinions, consumer protection enforcement, and multistate coordination mechanisms. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show how independent election, national ambition, and partisan coalition infrastructure incentivize AGs to pursue high-profile policy litigation over routine enforcement. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace the tobacco litigation model through subsequent multistate campaigns (pharmaceuticals, tech regulation, climate change) to illustrate the evolution of AG policy entrepreneurship. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use litigation databases, coalition membership records, campaign finance data, and settlement outcome analysis to document AG influence patterns. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate reforms including disclosed contingency-fee arrangements, litigation transparency requirements, and legislative oversight of AG settlement authority. [Observed]
6. **Takeaway:** State attorneys general demonstrate how independently elected officials with litigation authority can leverage multistate coordination to exercise national policy influence far beyond their formal jurisdiction. [Inferred]
