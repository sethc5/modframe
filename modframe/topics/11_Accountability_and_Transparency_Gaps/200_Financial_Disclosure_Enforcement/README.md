# Financial Disclosure Enforcement

**Purpose:** This module analyzes the federal financial disclosure enforcement architecture — filing requirements, DAEO review, OGE oversight, and DOJ criminal prosecution — showing how self-reported filings with value-range reporting, weak penalties, and no accuracy verification create paper compliance without genuine transparency.

## Key actors
- Public filers (OGE Form 278e, ~25,000 senior officials)
- Confidential filers (OGE Form 450, ~300,000 mid-level employees)
- Designated Agency Ethics Officials (filing review and certification)
- Office of Government Ethics (Senate-confirmed appointee review, regulations)
- DOJ Criminal Division (falsification prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1001)
- Senate confirmation process (pre-confirmation conflict analysis)
- Media and transparency organizations (external verification)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 101–111 (Ethics in Government Act, financial disclosure)
- 5 C.F.R. Part 2634 (OGE financial disclosure regulations)
- 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (false statements to the federal government)

## Case study
- **Systematic late filing patterns**: Annual data shows hundreds of senior federal officials filing financial disclosures late, paying the $200 penalty, and facing no further consequence — demonstrating that the penalty structure functions as a minor administrative fee rather than a compliance incentive.

## Data sources
- OGE financial disclosure database and annual reports
- Agency ethics program questionnaire data
- GAO reports on financial disclosure compliance
- OpenSecrets personal financial disclosure analysis
- Congressional Research Service reports on financial disclosure law
