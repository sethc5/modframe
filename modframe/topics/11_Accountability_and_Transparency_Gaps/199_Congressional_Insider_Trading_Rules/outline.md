# Congressional Insider Trading Rules

**Summary:** The STOCK Act of 2012 (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act) made it explicit that members of Congress and their staff are subject to insider trading prohibitions, required periodic transaction reports (PTRs) for securities trades over $1,000, and mandated online publication of financial disclosures — but the enforcement architecture relies on self-reporting with minimal verification, penalties that are trivially small relative to potential trading profits, and referral to DOJ and SEC for criminal enforcement that has produced almost no prosecutions against sitting members. [Observed] The structural incentive problem is that members of Congress receive material non-public information through committee work, classified briefings, and legislative negotiations, and the primary accountability mechanism — self-reported periodic transaction disclosures filed 30–45 days after the trade — creates a retrospective paper trail rather than a real-time constraint on trading behavior. [Observed] Late filing penalties ($200) are routinely paid without consequence, and the 2013 amendment that removed the online disclosure requirement for congressional staff further weakened transparency. [Observed] The system creates the appearance of trading regulation while structurally enabling the information advantage it purports to eliminate. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** The STOCK Act requires members of Congress to disclose securities trades but enforces compliance through self-reporting, trivial penalties, and prosecution referrals to DOJ that have produced near-zero enforcement against sitting members. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **Members of Congress** — subject to STOCK Act trading disclosure requirements and insider trading prohibitions; file periodic transaction reports (PTRs) within 30–45 days of transactions exceeding $1,000. [Observed] Incentive: comply with disclosure requirements to avoid political embarrassment. Constraint: the $200 late filing penalty provides minimal deterrence. [Observed]
- **Congressional staff** — senior staff subject to financial disclosure requirements; the 2013 amendment removed the requirement for online publication of staff disclosures, reducing public scrutiny. [Observed]
- **House Committee on Ethics / Senate Select Committee on Ethics** — receive and review financial disclosures; investigate potential STOCK Act violations; can refer matters to DOJ. [Observed] Constraint: self-policing dynamics limit aggressive investigation of colleagues. [Inferred]
- **DOJ Public Integrity Section** — receives referrals for potential insider trading by members of Congress; exercises prosecutorial discretion. [Observed] Constraint: proving congressional insider trading requires demonstrating that non-public information was material and was used to make trading decisions — a high evidentiary bar. [Observed]
- **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** — can investigate and bring civil enforcement actions for insider trading; has jurisdiction over congressional trading under general securities fraud authority. [Observed]
- **Government Accountability Office (GAO)** — has studied STOCK Act compliance and reporting patterns. [Observed]
- **Transparency organizations** (Quiver Quantitative, Capitol Trades, Unusual Whales) — aggregate and publish congressional trading disclosures for public analysis. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A member of Congress or covered staff member executes a securities transaction exceeding $1,000. [Observed]
- Within 30–45 days, the member is required to file a periodic transaction report (PTR) with the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate. [Observed — source: 15 U.S.C. § 78u–6]
- The PTR discloses the asset traded, approximate value range, transaction type (purchase/sale), and date — but not the specific price, timing relative to non-public information, or the rationale for the trade. [Observed]
- If the PTR is filed late, the member owes a $200 late filing fee; the fee can be waived by the supervising ethics officer. [Observed]
- The relevant ethics committee may review PTRs for potential STOCK Act violations, comparing trading patterns to committee assignments, briefings, and legislative activity. [Observed]
- If a potential violation is identified, the ethics committee may investigate internally, issue a private admonishment, or refer the matter to DOJ for criminal investigation. [Observed]
- DOJ evaluates the referral and decides whether to open an investigation and pursue prosecution; DOJ has broad discretion and has prosecuted very few congressional insider trading cases. [Observed]
- Financial disclosures (annual reports and PTRs) are published online for members of Congress but not for most congressional staff (post-2013 amendment). [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Ethics committees control investigation scope, referral decisions, and internal sanctions; DOJ controls prosecution decisions. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** The 30–45 day PTR filing window means trades are disclosed well after execution, limiting real-time public scrutiny and creating a window where information asymmetry can be exploited without detection. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Ethics committee chairs can deprioritize investigations; DOJ can decline referrals; fee waiver authority allows even the trivial $200 penalty to be forgiven. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Late filing is endemic: studies show that hundreds of PTRs are filed late each year, with members paying the $200 penalty (or receiving waivers) and facing no further consequence. [Observed]
- Value-range reporting (e.g., "$1,001–$15,000") obscures the actual scale of transactions, making it difficult to assess whether trading patterns correlate with non-public information. [Observed]
- Blind trusts, which would eliminate the information advantage problem, are not required; members can and do actively manage their own portfolios while serving on committees with jurisdiction over the industries they trade in. [Observed]
- The 2013 amendment removing online staff disclosure requirements created a transparency regression that reduced scrutiny of a key channel through which non-public information flows from members to trading decisions. [Observed]
- Correlation between committee assignments and trading patterns is statistically documented but proving causation (that a specific trade was based on specific non-public information) is extremely difficult, creating a structural prosecution gap. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze member trading returns versus market benchmarks, controlling for committee assignments, to test whether members outperform in sectors they oversee. [Observed — multiple academic studies have been conducted]
- Track late filing rates by member, chamber, and year to quantify compliance patterns. [Observed]
- Compare trading activity timing with committee briefings, classified briefings, and legislative markup schedules to test information-based trading hypotheses. [Inferred]
- Measure referral-to-prosecution rates for congressional insider trading cases at DOJ to quantify the enforcement pipeline. [Observed]
- Track the prevalence of blind trusts versus active portfolio management among members of Congress over time. [Observed]

### Suggested sources

- STOCK Act (Pub. L. 112–105, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78u–6 and other sections). [Observed]
- House and Senate financial disclosure databases. [Observed]

- Congressional Research Service, *The STOCK Act: Background and Implementation*. URL: https://crsreports.congress.gov [Observed]
- Academic studies on congressional trading performance (e.g., Ziobrowski et al., *Abnormal Returns from the Common Stock Investments of Members of the U.S. House of Representatives*). [Observed]
- Capitol Trades / Quiver Quantitative / Unusual Whales (aggregated congressional trading data). [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the STOCK Act disclosure architecture — PTR filing requirements, periodic and annual disclosure, value-range reporting, and the self-policing enforcement pipeline. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why the structural design (delayed reporting, trivial penalties, self-policing, high prosecution bar) creates a system that documents insider information advantages without constraining them. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace documented cases of trading activity by members that correlated with committee knowledge or pre-legislative information, showing the disclosure timeline and enforcement outcome. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present late filing rates, trading return analysis versus benchmarks, committee-sector correlation data, and prosecution statistics. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate mandatory blind trusts, real-time disclosure requirements, independent enforcement authority, increased penalties, and trading bans for members while in office. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The STOCK Act creates a disclosure system for congressional trading but structures that system to document information advantages rather than eliminate them — the transparency is the substitute for the constraint. [Inferred]
