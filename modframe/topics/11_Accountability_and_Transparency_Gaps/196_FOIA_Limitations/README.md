# FOIA Limitations

**Purpose:** This module analyzes the structural limitations of the Freedom of Information Act as an accountability tool, mapping how exemptions, processing backlogs, enforcement costs, and agency incentives combine to create a system that filters out all but the most well-resourced and persistent requesters.

Status: draft

Tags: accountability, transparency, oversight, FOIA, exemptions, backlogs, public-records, disclosure

## Key actors
- Agency FOIA offices (processing, exemption application)
- Agency leadership / General Counsel (FOIA policy, sensitive records)
- DOJ Office of Information Policy (government-wide guidance, litigation defense)
- Office of Government Information Services (OGIS, FOIA ombudsman)
- Federal courts (FOIA litigation, de novo review)
- Chief FOIA Officers (compliance reporting)
- FOIA requesters (journalists, NGOs, researchers, individuals)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- 5 U.S.C. § 552 (Freedom of Information Act, as amended)
- FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (Pub. L. 114–185)
- OPEN Government Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110–75)
- Executive Order 13526 (classified national security information)

## Case study
- **FOIA backlog at DHS/CBP**: Customs and Border Protection maintains one of the largest FOIA backlogs in the federal government, with average response times measured in years for complex requests, illustrating how structural understaffing creates de facto withholding through delay.

## Data sources
- FOIA.gov (government-wide FOIA processing data)
- OGIS FOIA compliance assessments
- GAO FOIA processing and backlog reports
- Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press FOIA litigation data
- Agency annual FOIA reports
