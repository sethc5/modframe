# Ethics Waivers for Political Appointees

**Purpose:** This module maps the structural architecture of ethics waivers under 18 U.S.C. § 208(b) and executive order ethics pledges, analyzing how the waiver mechanism converts conflict-of-interest prohibitions from hard constraints into discretionary permissions.

## Key actors
- Agency heads (waiver-granting authority under § 208(b))
- Political appointees (waiver recipients)
- Office of Government Ethics (advisory review, no veto)
- Designated Agency Ethics Officials (waiver drafting and compliance monitoring)
- White House Counsel (ethics pledge waiver administration)
- Congressional oversight committees
- Transparency organizations (CREW, POGO)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- 18 U.S.C. § 208 (criminal conflict-of-interest statute; waiver authority at § 208(b)(1) and (b)(3))
- 5 C.F.R. § 2640 (OGE regulations on exemptions and waivers)
- Executive Order 13770 (Trump administration ethics pledge, 2017)
- Executive Order 13989 (Biden administration ethics pledge, 2021)

## Case study
- **Trump and Biden administration ethics waivers**: Comparison of proactive disclosure practices, waiver scope, and volume across administrations demonstrates how the same waiver mechanism produces dramatically different transparency outcomes depending on executive policy.

## Data sources
- OGE ethics waiver database and annual reports
- FOIA requests for agency-specific waiver grants
- CREW ethics waiver trackers
- Congressional Research Service reports on ethics pledge enforcement
- Financial disclosure filings (cross-reference with waiver participation)
