# Office of Government Ethics (OGE)

**Purpose:** This module provides a comprehensive structural analysis of OGE as an institution — its statutory mandate, organizational design, DAEO implementation system, and the fundamental tension between its standard-setting authority and its lack of enforcement power.

Status: draft

Tags: accountability, transparency, oversight, OGE, ethics, financial-disclosure, executive-branch, DAEO

## Key actors
- OGE Director (five-year term, presidential appointment)
- OGE program staff (~70 employees)
- Designated Agency Ethics Officials (agency-level implementation)
- Agency heads (recommendation implementation decisions)
- DOJ Public Integrity Section (criminal referral prosecution)
- Senate HSGAC (oversight, Director confirmation)
- The President (appointment, removal, ethics culture)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 401–408 (Ethics in Government Act, OGE authority)
- 5 C.F.R. Parts 2634–2641 (OGE regulations: standards of conduct, financial disclosure, conflicts)
- Executive Order 12674 (Principles of Ethical Conduct for Government Officers and Employees)

## Case study
- **OGE under the Trump administration (2017–2021)**: OGE Director Walter Shaub's public clashes with the incoming administration over financial disclosure and divestiture requirements demonstrated both the office's ability to generate public accountability through transparency and its inability to compel compliance when the administration chose not to cooperate.

## Data sources
- OGE annual reports and agency ethics program questionnaire data
- OGE program review reports
- OGE financial disclosure database
- GAO reports on executive branch ethics programs
- Congressional Research Service reports on OGE authority
