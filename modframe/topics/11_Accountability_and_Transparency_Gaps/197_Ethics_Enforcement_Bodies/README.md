# Ethics Enforcement Bodies

**Purpose:** This module maps the full landscape of federal ethics enforcement bodies — OGE, agency ethics offices, DOJ, OSC, congressional ethics committees, and OCE — analyzing how the distribution of jurisdiction without centralized enforcement authority creates structural gaps that sophisticated actors can navigate.

Tags: accountability, transparency, oversight, ethics, enforcement, OGE, OSC, Hatch-Act, congressional-ethics

## Key actors
- Office of Government Ethics (standards and guidance, no enforcement)
- Designated Agency Ethics Officials (agency-level implementation)
- DOJ Public Integrity Section (criminal prosecution)
- Office of Special Counsel (Hatch Act, prohibited personnel practices)
- House Committee on Ethics (congressional self-policing)
- Senate Select Committee on Ethics (congressional self-policing)
- Office of Congressional Ethics (independent review, referral only)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 401–408 (Ethics in Government Act, OGE authority)
- 18 U.S.C. §§ 202–209 (criminal conflict-of-interest statutes)
- 5 U.S.C. §§ 1211–1219 (Office of Special Counsel authority)
- 5 U.S.C. §§ 7321–7326 (Hatch Act)
- House Rule XXVI (Committee on Ethics jurisdiction)

## Case study
- **OSC Hatch Act referrals for senior officials**: The Office of Special Counsel has referred multiple Hatch Act violation reports to the President for senior White House officials, but presidential inaction on referrals demonstrates the structural limitation of an enforcement body that cannot impose its own sanctions on senior appointees.

## Data sources
- OGE annual reports and compliance data
- OSC Hatch Act enforcement reports
- House Ethics Committee annual reports and investigation summaries
- OCE annual reports and referral data
- DOJ Public Integrity Section annual reports
- GAO reports on federal ethics program effectiveness
