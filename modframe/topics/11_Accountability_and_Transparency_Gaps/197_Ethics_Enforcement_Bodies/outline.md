# Ethics Enforcement Bodies

**Summary:** Federal ethics enforcement is distributed across multiple bodies — the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), agency ethics offices (DAEOs), the DOJ Public Integrity Section, congressional ethics committees, and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) — each with partial jurisdiction, limited enforcement tools, and no centralized authority to compel compliance across the executive branch. [Observed] OGE sets standards and reviews financial disclosures but cannot impose discipline; DAEOs implement ethics programs within agencies but report to the agency heads whose conduct they monitor; DOJ can prosecute criminal violations but exercises broad discretion on which cases to pursue. [Observed] Congressional ethics enforcement (House Committee on Ethics, Senate Select Committee on Ethics) operates under self-policing norms where members investigate their own colleagues, producing consistently low sanction rates. [Observed] The structural result is an ethics architecture where no single entity has the authority, independence, and enforcement tools to hold senior officials accountable, and the distribution of jurisdiction creates gaps that sophisticated actors can navigate. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Ethics enforcement is distributed across bodies that each lack the combination of independence, jurisdiction, and enforcement power needed to constrain the officials whose conduct they are supposed to regulate. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Office of Government Ethics (OGE)** — sets government-wide ethics standards, reviews financial disclosures for Senate-confirmed appointees, issues ethics guidance, and refers potential violations to agencies and DOJ. [Observed — source: 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 401–408] Constraint: no direct enforcement authority; relies on agency heads to implement recommendations and DOJ to pursue referrals. [Observed]
- **Designated Agency Ethics Officials (DAEOs)** — implement agency ethics programs, screen financial disclosures, advise employees on ethics obligations, and recommend corrective action. [Observed] Constraint: report to the agency head, creating a structural conflict when the agency head's conduct is at issue. [Observed]
- **DOJ Public Integrity Section** — prosecutes criminal ethics violations (18 U.S.C. §§ 202–209); exercises prosecutorial discretion on case selection. [Observed] Constraint: high evidentiary burden for criminal prosecution; institutional reluctance to pursue politically sensitive cases. [Observed]
- **Office of Special Counsel (OSC)** — enforces the Hatch Act (political activity restrictions), investigates prohibited personnel practices, and provides a channel for whistleblower disclosures. [Observed — source: 5 U.S.C. §§ 1211–1219] Constraint: can recommend discipline but cannot impose it on presidential appointees; can only refer senior official cases to the President. [Observed]
- **House Committee on Ethics** — investigates and adjudicates ethics complaints against House members and staff; self-policing body where members judge their own colleagues. [Observed] Constraint: institutional reluctance to sanction colleagues creates a bias toward dismissal or mild sanctions. [Inferred]
- **Senate Select Committee on Ethics** — parallel function for Senate members and staff; same self-policing structural limitation. [Observed]
- **Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE)** — independent, non-partisan entity that reviews allegations against House members and staff and refers findings to the House Ethics Committee; cannot impose sanctions and can be overridden by the committee it reports to. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A potential ethics violation is identified through financial disclosure review, whistleblower complaint, media reporting, IG investigation, or self-reporting. [Observed]
- The matter is routed to the relevant enforcement body based on the type of violation and the official's position: OGE/DAEO for executive branch administrative violations, DOJ for criminal violations, OSC for Hatch Act violations, congressional ethics committees for legislative branch violations. [Observed]
- The receiving body evaluates the complaint, investigates (with varying investigative authority and resources), and determines whether to take action. [Observed]
- For executive branch administrative violations, OGE may recommend corrective action to the agency head, who decides whether to implement it. [Observed]
- For criminal violations, DOJ decides whether to prosecute; declination decisions are not publicly explained and are not reviewable. [Observed]
- For Hatch Act violations by senior officials, OSC refers reports to the President, who has sole authority to impose discipline; for other employees, OSC can seek disciplinary action through MSPB. [Observed]
- For congressional ethics violations, the relevant ethics committee determines whether to investigate, issue a public report, recommend sanctions, or dismiss the complaint. [Observed]
- Sanctions range from counseling letters to censure, reprimand, or expulsion (Congress) and from informal counseling to removal (executive branch); severe sanctions are rarely imposed on senior officials. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** DOJ's prosecutorial discretion determines which criminal violations are pursued; agency heads determine which administrative recommendations are implemented; congressional ethics chairs control committee agendas and investigation scope. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** OGE's lack of enforcement authority means that even well-documented violations depend on agency and DOJ willingness to act. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** The President can decline to discipline senior officials referred by OSC; the House Ethics Committee can decline to act on OCE referrals; agency heads can decline to implement OGE recommendations. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Jurisdictional gaps between enforcement bodies allow sophisticated actors to navigate between the cracks: conduct that violates administrative ethics rules but falls below the criminal threshold may receive no meaningful sanction if the agency declines to act. [Inferred]
- Congressional self-policing produces consistently low sanction rates and lengthy investigation timelines that outlast the electoral cycle, allowing accused members to complete their terms before resolution. [Observed]
- OSC Hatch Act enforcement against senior officials is structurally limited: cases are referred to the President, who has no obligation to act and may have political incentives to protect the accused official. [Observed]
- OGE's advisory model means that the most it can do in response to a compliance failure is issue a public letter or recommend action to an agency head who may decline to respond. [Observed]
- Ethics enforcement bodies are chronically under-resourced relative to the volume of potential violations across the federal workforce and Congress. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Map all ethics enforcement actions by body, violation type, and official seniority level over the past 20 years to test whether enforcement correlates with official rank. [Observed]
- Track OCE referral-to-action rates at the House Ethics Committee to quantify congressional self-policing effectiveness. [Observed]
- Compare OGE recommendation implementation rates across agencies to test whether administrative enforcement is consistent. [Inferred]
- Analyze OSC Hatch Act referrals to the President and track presidential response rates and timelines. [Observed]
- Measure ethics enforcement body budget and staffing trends against workload growth to test the chronic under-resourcing hypothesis. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the full landscape of ethics enforcement bodies — OGE, DAEOs, DOJ, OSC, congressional committees, OCE — and show how jurisdiction, independence, and enforcement tools are distributed. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why the distribution of enforcement authority without centralized independence creates a system where each body has reasons to defer to others. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific ethics violation through multiple enforcement bodies, showing how jurisdictional routing, prosecutorial discretion, and institutional self-policing produce an outcome weaker than any single body would impose independently. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present enforcement action data by body, sanction severity distributions, referral-to-action rates, and resource allocation trends. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate centralized ethics enforcement authority, mandatory action on referrals, independent congressional ethics enforcement, OGE enforcement power, and OSC authority to directly discipline senior officials. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The fragmented ethics enforcement architecture ensures that no single entity can hold a senior official accountable — the system distributes responsibility until it evaporates. [Inferred]
