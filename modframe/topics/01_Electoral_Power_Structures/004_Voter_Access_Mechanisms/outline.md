# Voter Access Mechanisms

**Summary:** The rules governing who may vote and how they exercise that right are set
primarily by state governments, producing a nationwide patchwork of registration
requirements, identification rules, polling place distributions, early voting windows,
and absentee ballot procedures. [Observed — source: U.S. Const. art. I, § 4; state
election codes; NCSL voting laws survey] Federal statutes — including the National Voter
Registration Act (NVRA, 1993), the Help America Vote Act (HAVA, 2002), and the Voting
Rights Act (VRA, 1965) — set minimum procedural floors but leave the vast majority of
access decisions to state discretion. [Observed — source: 52 U.S.C. § 20501; 52 U.S.C.
§ 21081; 52 U.S.C. § 10301] The Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in *Shelby County v.
Holder* eliminated the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirement, which had required
jurisdictions with histories of voting discrimination to obtain federal approval before
changing voting rules, removing the principal structural mechanism for pre-enforcement
federal oversight. [Observed — source: Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013)]
Because voter access rules are set by the same legislative majorities that benefit from
election outcomes, the mechanism concentrates rulemaking authority in actors with
structural incentives to design rules that advantage their own coalition.
[Inferred — the coincidence of rulemaking authority and electoral interest is structural;
specific intent is difficult to prove in individual cases without direct evidence]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** State legislatures set the rules for who may register to
vote, what identification is required, where polling places are located, and how ballots
are cast — with federal courts as the primary post-enactment check since *Shelby County*
eliminated pre-enforcement review. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **State legislatures** — hold primary constitutional authority to set election
  administration rules under Article I, § 4; set voter registration deadlines,
  identification requirements, early voting windows, absentee ballot eligibility, and
  polling place allocation formulas; incentive: rules that mobilize a party's base and
  impose costs on opponents' are structurally advantageous; constraint: must comply with
  NVRA, HAVA, VRA Section 2, and constitutional equal protection and due process
  requirements. [Observed — source: U.S. Const. art. I, § 4; 52 U.S.C. § 10301]

- **State and local election officials** (Secretaries of State, county clerks, boards of
  elections) — administer voter rolls, set polling place locations within statutory
  frameworks, manage voter list maintenance; incentive: often appointed or elected on
  partisan basis, creating alignment between administration decisions and political
  interests; constraint: NVRA list maintenance requirements, HAVA provisional ballot
  mandate. [Observed — source: 52 U.S.C. §§ 20507, 21082]

- **Election Assistance Commission (EAC)** — independent federal agency created by HAVA;
  develops voluntary voting system guidelines, certifies testing laboratories, and
  administers the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS); does not have
  enforcement authority over state election practices; incentive: maintain bipartisan
  credibility; constraint: advisory role only, no rulemaking or enforcement power over
  state access rules. [Observed — source: 52 U.S.C. §§ 20921–20929]

- **Department of Justice (Civil Rights Division)** — enforces VRA Section 2 through
  litigation; formerly administered Section 5 preclearance review; since *Shelby County*,
  limited to post-enactment litigation; incentive: varies with administration; constraint:
  litigation is slow, resource-intensive, and requires proving discriminatory effect or
  purpose after rules are already in effect. [Observed — source: 52 U.S.C. § 10308;
  Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013)]

- **Federal courts** — review challenges under VRA Section 2, the Equal Protection
  Clause, and the Twenty-Fourth Amendment (poll tax prohibition); cannot preemptively
  block state laws without preliminary injunction; post-*Brnovich v. DNC* (2021),
  Section 2 challenges to facially neutral voting rules face higher burden; constraint:
  courts act only on filed cases and cannot monitor state compliance proactively.
  [Observed — source: Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, 594 U.S. 647 (2021)]

- **Voters** — bear the direct costs of compliance with access requirements (obtaining
  qualifying ID, traveling to polling locations, meeting registration deadlines);
  differential cost burden across demographic groups is a measured empirical phenomenon;
  constraint: costs of individual legal challenges are prohibitive without organizational
  backing. [Observed — source: MIT Cost of Voting Index; Hajnal, Lajevardi, and Nielson
  (2017) on voter ID turnout effects]

### Process map (bulleted)

- **Step 1 — Voter registration:** Voter registers with state or local election authority;
  deadline ranges from same day in 21 states to 30 days before the election in others;
  NVRA requires states to offer registration at motor vehicle agencies and public
  assistance offices; some states have implemented automatic voter registration (AVR)
  linking DMV records to voter rolls. [Observed — source: 52 U.S.C. § 20504; NCSL
  registration deadline survey]

- **Step 2 — Identification at the polls:** Voter presents required documentation;
  requirements range from no ID required (signature match or poll worker recognition) to
  strict photo ID (government-issued photo ID mandatory, no alternative); *Crawford v.
  Marion County Election Board* (2008) upheld Indiana's strict photo ID law; 35 states
  now have some form of voter ID law. [Observed — source: Crawford v. Marion County
  Election Board, 553 U.S. 181 (2008); NCSL voter ID law survey, 2024]

- **Step 3 — Polling place assignment and access:** Voters are assigned to a polling
  location by county or municipal election officials; early voting availability, hours,
  and location count are set by state law; closing or consolidating polling places can
  increase travel distance and wait times; EAC data tracks wait times by jurisdiction.
  [Observed — source: EAC EAVS 2022; GAO, "Voters with Disabilities: Observations on
  Polling Place Accessibility," GAO-17-485 (2017)]

- **Step 4 — Casting a ballot:** Voters cast their ballot in person or by absentee/mail
  depending on state eligibility rules; HAVA requires states to offer provisional ballots
  to voters whose registration is questioned at the polls; provisional ballot acceptance
  rates vary significantly by state. [Observed — source: 52 U.S.C. § 21082; EAC
  Provisional Ballot Study]

- **Step 5 — Voter roll maintenance:** Between elections, state officials conduct list
  maintenance — removing voters who have moved, died, or been convicted of disqualifying
  felonies; NVRA sets requirements for the process, including notice requirements and
  timing restrictions (no purges within 90 days of a federal election); aggressive purge
  programs using imprecise matching can remove eligible voters. [Observed — source: 52
  U.S.C. § 20507; *Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst.*, 584 U.S. 1 (2018)]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** State legislatures that set the entire access framework — registration
  deadlines, ID requirements, polling hours, absentee eligibility; county election
  officials who allocate polling places within state parameters; the EAC which certifies
  voting systems (effectively limiting which technology states may deploy). [Observed —
  source: state election codes; NCSL survey]

- **Bottlenecks:** Voter ID requirements create a documentary bottleneck for voters
  without qualifying government-issued ID; registration deadlines exclude late-deciding
  or recently moved voters; polling place consolidation creates geographic bottlenecks
  requiring longer travel or longer waits. [Observed — source: MIT Cost of Voting Index;
  GAO wait time studies]

- **Veto points:** Federal courts reviewing Section 2 VRA claims or constitutional
  challenges (post-enactment, slow); DOJ Section 2 litigation (resource-constrained);
  state governors who may veto access-restriction legislation; since *Shelby County*,
  the Section 5 preclearance veto point — the only pre-enforcement check — has been
  eliminated. [Observed — source: Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013)]

### Common failure modes

- **Preclearance elimination creating a litigation gap** — [Observed] Before *Shelby
  County*, states covered under Section 5 had to demonstrate new voting rules were
  non-discriminatory before they took effect; since 2013, all challenges must be
  litigated post-enactment, often after the affected election has occurred. The number
  of voter restriction laws enacted in formerly-covered jurisdictions increased
  substantially after *Shelby County*. [Source: Brennan Center, "New Voting Restrictions
  in America" (2017); Voting Rights Lab state tracker]

- **Strict photo ID and demographic cost asymmetry** — [Observed] Government-issued
  photo ID possession rates vary across demographic groups; studies consistently find
  lower possession rates among low-income, elderly, and certain minority populations.
  A 2017 study found strict voter ID laws associated with a widening turnout gap between
  white and minority voters in general elections. [Source: Hajnal, Lajevardi, and Nielson,
  "Voter Identification Laws and the Suppression of Minority Votes," Journal of Politics
  (2017)]

- **Voter roll purge errors** — [Observed] List maintenance programs using name-matching
  or address-change data can produce false positives — removing eligible, registered
  voters. Ohio's aggressive confirmation notice process was upheld by SCOTUS in *Husted*
  (2018); separate programs using multi-state data comparison (e.g., Interstate
  Crosscheck) were found to have high false-positive rates and have since been
  discontinued. [Source: *Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst.*, 584 U.S. 1 (2018); GAO
  report on voter roll maintenance practices]

- **Polling place consolidation and wait times** — [Inferred] Reducing the number of
  polling places increases travel distance and concentrates voters at fewer locations,
  mechanically increasing wait times. GAO and EAC data document longer average wait
  times in jurisdictions with fewer polling places per registered voter. Whether
  consolidation decisions are made with the intent to affect participation is a separate
  question requiring case-by-case analysis. [Source: GAO, "Elections: Issues Related to
  Registering Voters and Administering Elections," GAO-16-630 (2016); EAC EAVS wait
  time data]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Comparative turnout analysis before and after specific access-rule changes (controlling
  for other variables) would isolate the effect of individual rules on participation
- EAC EAVS provisional ballot data (acceptance and rejection rates by state and reason)
  would track provisional ballot system effectiveness
- MIT Cost of Voting Index state rankings over time would measure overall access
  environment changes
- Cross-state natural experiment: states with same-day registration vs. early-deadline
  states, holding other factors constant, for registration and turnout effects
- Section 2 litigation outcomes — claims filed, injunctions granted, trial wins, appeals
  — would track enforcement system effectiveness post-*Shelby County*

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure** — The rules determining who can vote and how are set by state
   governments within federal floors established by the NVRA, HAVA, and the VRA; since
   *Shelby County* (2013) eliminated Section 5 preclearance, the primary enforcement
   mechanism is post-enactment litigation rather than pre-enforcement review.

2. **Incentive** — State legislatures control access rules and face elections under those
   same rules; the party in power has structural incentives to design rules that reduce
   costs for their own coalition and increase costs for the opposing coalition; individual
   legislators may simultaneously have sincere beliefs about fraud prevention or
   administrative efficiency as justifications.

3. **Example** — Following *Shelby County* (2013), Texas immediately implemented a
   strict photo ID law that had previously been blocked under Section 5 preclearance; a
   federal district court found in 2017 that the law was enacted with discriminatory
   intent, but it remained in effect through multiple election cycles during litigation.
   [Observed — source: *Veasey v. Abbott*, 888 F.3d 792 (5th Cir. 2018)]

4. **Evidence** — EAC Election Administration and Voting Survey; MIT Cost of Voting
   Index; Brennan Center state voting law tracker; VRA Section 2 litigation docket;
   GAO studies on polling place accessibility and wait times; academic turnout studies
   using state-year panel data.

5. **Levers** — Automatic voter registration (AVR) reduces registration barriers at the
   administrative level; federal legislation restoring or replacing Section 5
   preclearance would reinstate pre-enforcement review (prior attempts: John Lewis Voting
   Rights Advancement Act, Freedom to Vote Act); same-day registration substantially
   reduces deadline-driven disenfranchisement; federal minimum standards for polling
   place ratios could address consolidation.

6. **Takeaway** — Voter access rules are set by actors with direct electoral stakes in
   their design; the structural check — federal pre-enforcement review under Section 5 —
   was eliminated in 2013, leaving post-enactment litigation as the primary remedy and
   creating a system where rules affecting election outcomes can be implemented and take
   effect before courts can review them.
