# State Certification Processes

**Summary:** State certification converts local canvass results into a single,
legally recognized statewide outcome and a `Certificate of Ascertainment` that
is transmitted to federal authorities. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; National
Archives guidance] Certification aggregates county canvass records, finalizes
which candidate is reported as the statewide winner, and creates the administrative
record that courts and Congress rely on when disputes arise. [Observed — source:
NCSL certification guidance; CRS analysis]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** State officials consolidate county canvass records,
issue a certificate of the statewide result, and transmit it to federal repositories
and Congress. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; National Archives]

### Actors and roles

- **County election officials** — perform canvass, reconcile provisional ballots, run
  post‑election audits, and produce local certification packages that feed the state
  canvass. [Observed — source: state election codes; NCSL]

- **State canvassing authority / Secretary of State** — conducts the statewide canvass,
  certifies the official result, issues the Certificate of Ascertainment, and transmits
  official documents to the National Archives. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; NARA]

- **State legislature** — prescribes timing, procedures, and who certifies results by
  statute; can set review or override rules subject to constitutional constraints.
  [Observed — source: state statutes; *McPherson v. Blacker*]

- **Governors** — in some states involved in executing the certificate or in procedural
  sign‑offs; governors may be relevant gatekeepers when competing slates are presented.
  [Inferred — role varies by state; check state codes]

- **State courts** — resolve post‑certification disputes, interpret certification rules,
  and can order remedial measures such as recounts or supplemental canvasses. [Observed
  — source: state case law examples]

- **Federal actors (NARA, Congress)** — receive certificates and rely on state certification
  in the congressional counting process; Congress's role is ministerial absent a
  demonstrated constitutional defect. [Observed — source: National Archives; 3 U.S.C.]

### Process map (bulleted)

- **Step 1 — Local canvass and reconciliation:** Counties complete vote counts, resolve
  provisional ballots, and certify precinct/county tallies. [Observed — source: state
  election codes]

- **Step 2 — State canvass:** State canvassing board or Secretary of State aggregates
  county returns, runs required audits, and prepares the statewide certification
  package. [Observed — source: NCSL; state certification procedures]

- **Step 3 — Certification & Certificate of Ascertainment:** State authority issues the
  Certificate of Ascertainment and transmits it to the National Archives and to
  Congress per federal deadlines. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; NARA guidance]

- **Step 4 — Post‑certification remedies:** Courts or recount statutes can alter results
  before deadlines; competing certificates may arise if contest procedures remain
  unresolved. [Observed — source: state recount statutes; court opinions]

- **Step 5 — Federal reliance:** Congress and federal repositories treat the governor‑/SoS‑
  certified slate as the official record absent a specific constitutional defect. [Observed
  — source: 3 U.S.C.; CRS analysis]

### Where power concentrates

- **County canvass boards** control the first authoritative counts and therefore can
  produce wiring errors or corrections that materially affect statewide totals.
  [Observed — source: county canvass procedures]

- **State certification authority (SoS / canvass board)** is the legal gatekeeper that
  determines the official statewide outcome and timing for transmitting federal
  materials. [Observed — source: state statutes; NCSL]

- **State courts and statutory deadlines** create bottlenecks: compressed timelines for
  recounts or adjudication can elevate small procedural disputes into consequential
  certification outcomes. [Inferred — compressed deadlines increase litigated outcomes]

### Common failure modes

- **Missed or ambiguous deadlines** — inconsistent statutory deadlines or missed safe‑harbor
  windows create legal uncertainty and competing certifications. [Observed — source:
  3 U.S.C. § 5 and state code comparisons]

- **Inadequate audits or reconciliation** — weak post‑election audit procedures increase
  the risk of later corrections that complicate certification. [Observed — source: audit
  reports; NCSL post‑election audit surveys]

- **Competing certificates and procedural ambiguity** — when statutes or practice allow
  multiple actors to claim certifying authority, rival slates or litigation can follow.
  [Observed — source: documented state disputes]

- **Partisan or extrajudicial pressure on certifiers** — pressure to alter or delay
  certification can undermine public trust and produce contested outcomes. [Inferred —
  documented pressure events correlate with contested certification episodes]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Complete county canvass logs, Certificates of Ascertainment, and state canvass
  minutes (prove who certified and when). [Observed — source: NARA; state records]
- Post‑election audit reports and tabulation logs (test whether canvass reconciled totals).
  [Observed — source: state audit offices; NIST/EAC guidance]
- Court opinions and statutory texts resolving certification authority disputes. [Observed]
- Time‑series of certification timelines across states to test whether compressing deadlines
  increases litigation incidence. [Hypothesis — testable with event data]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure** — State certification converts county canvass outputs into a single
   statewide record and a Certificate of Ascertainment that federal actors receive.
   [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; NARA]

2. **Incentive** — State officials balance accuracy, speed, and legal defensibility; local
   officials prioritize accurate canvass records while state officials prioritize meeting
   statutory deadlines and producing a defensible certificate. [Inferred]

3. **Example** — Georgia (2020): multiple recounts, an independent risk‑limiting audit,
   and subsequent litigation produced a certified statewide result that was relied on
   by federal repositories and Congress. [Observed — source: Georgia Secretary of State
   certification records; audit reports]

4. **Evidence** — County canvass minutes, state canvass certificates, audit reports,
   and court opinions resolving post‑certification challenges.

5. **Levers** — Strengthening post‑election audit mandates, harmonizing deadlines across
   statutes, and clarifying statutory certification authority reduce ambiguity and
   litigation risk. [Inferred]

6. **Takeaway** — Certification is the final administrative step that makes local counts
   legally operative at the state and federal levels; the quality of audits, the clarity
   of statutory roles, and the speed of adjudication determine whether certification
   produces a stable public record. [Observed]
