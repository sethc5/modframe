# State Certification Processes

**Summary:** State certification converts local canvass results into a single,
legally recognized statewide outcome and a Certificate of Ascertainment transmitted
to the National Archives and Congress. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; National
Archives, Certificate of Ascertainment guidance] Certification aggregates county
canvass records, determines which candidate is the statewide winner, and creates the
administrative record that courts and Congress rely on when disputes arise. [Observed
— source: NCSL, Canvass and Certification of Election Results, 2023] Federal law
establishes a Safe Harbor Deadline — six days before the Electoral College meets —
by which a state that certifies its results in conformance with state law receives
conclusive deference from Congress. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 5 as amended by
P.L. 117-328] The Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-328) additionally
requires governors to transmit a single conclusive Certificate of Ascertainment,
closing prior statutory ambiguity about competing slates. [Observed — source: P.L.
117-328, Div. P, § 102; CRS R47031]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** State officials consolidate county canvass records,
issue a certificate of the statewide result, and transmit it to federal repositories
and Congress. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; National Archives]

### Actors and roles

- **County election officials** — perform canvass, reconcile provisional ballots, run
  post‑election audits, and produce local certification packages that feed the state
  canvass. [Observed — source: state election codes; NCSL]

- **State canvassing authority / Secretary of State** — conducts the statewide canvass,
  certifies the official result, issues the Certificate of Ascertainment, and transmits
  official documents to the National Archives. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; NARA]

- **State legislature** — prescribes timing, procedures, and who certifies results by
  statute; can set review or override rules subject to constitutional constraints.
  [Observed — source: state statutes; *McPherson v. Blacker*]

- **Governors** — in some states involved in executing the certificate or in procedural
  sign‑offs; governors may be relevant gatekeepers when competing slates are presented.
  [Inferred — role varies by state; check state codes]

- **State courts** — resolve post-certification disputes, interpret certification rules,
  and can order remedial measures such as recounts or supplemental canvasses; federal
  courts may review challenges grounded in federal constitutional claims but generally
  defer to state courts on interpretation of state election law. [Observed — source:
  *Wood v. Raffensperger*, No. 20-14418 (11th Cir. 2020); *Pearson v. Kemp*, No.
  1:20-cv-04809 (N.D. Ga. 2020)]

- **Federal actors (NARA, Congress)** — receive certificates and rely on state certification
  in the congressional counting process; Congress's role is ministerial absent a
  demonstrated constitutional defect. [Observed — source: National Archives; 3 U.S.C.]

### Process map (bulleted)

- **Step 1 — Local canvass and reconciliation:** Counties complete vote counts, resolve
  provisional ballots, and certify precinct/county tallies. [Observed — source: state
  election codes]

- **Step 2 — State canvass:** State canvassing board or Secretary of State aggregates
  county returns, runs required audits, and prepares the statewide certification
  package. [Observed — source: NCSL; state certification procedures]

- **Step 3 — Certification & Certificate of Ascertainment:** State authority issues the
  Certificate of Ascertainment and transmits it to the National Archives and to
  Congress per federal deadlines. [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; NARA guidance]

- **Step 4 — Post‑certification remedies:** Courts or recount statutes can alter results
  before deadlines; competing certificates may arise if contest procedures remain
  unresolved. [Observed — source: state recount statutes; court opinions]

- **Step 5 — Federal reliance:** Congress and federal repositories treat the governor‑/SoS‑
  certified slate as the official record absent a specific constitutional defect. [Observed
  — source: 3 U.S.C.; CRS analysis]

### Where power concentrates

- **County canvass boards** control the first authoritative counts and therefore can
  produce wiring errors or corrections that materially affect statewide totals.
  [Observed — source: county canvass procedures]

- **State certification authority (SoS / canvass board)** is the legal gatekeeper that
  determines the official statewide outcome and timing for transmitting federal
  materials. [Observed — source: state statutes; NCSL]

- **State courts and statutory deadlines** create bottlenecks: compressed timelines for
  recounts or adjudication can elevate small procedural disputes into consequential
  certification outcomes. [Inferred — compressed deadlines increase litigated outcomes]

### Common failure modes

- **Missed or ambiguous deadlines** — inconsistent statutory deadlines or missed safe‑harbor
  windows create legal uncertainty and competing certifications. [Observed — source:
  3 U.S.C. § 5 and state code comparisons]

- **Inadequate audits or reconciliation** — weak post‑election audit procedures increase
  the risk of later corrections that complicate certification. [Observed — source: audit
  reports; NCSL post‑election audit surveys]

- **Competing certificates and procedural ambiguity** — when statutes or practice allow
  multiple actors to claim certifying authority, rival slates or litigation can follow;
  in November 2020 two Republican members of the Wayne County, Michigan canvassing board
  initially refused to certify the county result, then reversed and voted to certify,
  then sought (unsuccessfully) to rescind their votes after the certification deadline
  had passed — establishing that post-deadline rescission has no legal effect under
  Michigan law. [Observed — source: Michigan Board of State Canvassers, November 17,
  2020 meeting minutes (Michigan Department of State public record); CRS R47031]

- **Direct pressure on certification officials** — certification officials can face
  documented pressure to alter results before statutory deadlines; on January 2, 2021,
  President Trump called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and requested he
  "find 11,780 votes" — a number precisely exceeding Trump's certified Georgia margin of
  loss; the call was recorded and released publicly by Raffensperger's office on January
  3, 2021; Raffensperger declined and the certification stood. [Observed — source:
  Georgia Secretary of State, transcript of January 2, 2021 phone call (released January
  3, 2021); Senate Judiciary Committee, "Subverting Justice: How the Former President and
  His Allies Pressured DOJ to Overturn the 2020 Election," August 7, 2021]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Complete county canvass logs, Certificates of Ascertainment, and state canvass
  minutes (prove who certified and when). [Observed — source: NARA; state records]
- Post‑election audit reports and tabulation logs (test whether canvass reconciled totals).
  [Observed — source: state audit offices; NIST/EAC guidance]
- Court opinions and statutory texts resolving certification authority disputes. [Observed
  — source: *Wood v. Raffensperger*, No. 20-14418 (11th Cir. 2020); *Pearson v. Kemp*,
  No. 1:20-cv-04809 (N.D. Ga. 2020)]
- Time‑series of certification timelines across states to test whether compressing deadlines
  increases litigation incidence. [Hypothesis — testable with event data]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure** — State certification converts county canvass outputs into a single
   statewide record and a Certificate of Ascertainment that federal actors receive.
   [Observed — source: 3 U.S.C. § 6; NARA]

2. **Incentive** — State officials balance accuracy, speed, and legal defensibility; local
   officials prioritize accurate canvass records while state officials prioritize meeting
   statutory deadlines and producing a defensible certificate. [Inferred]

3. **Example** — Georgia (2020): Biden's 11,779-vote margin over Trump triggered three
   sequential post-election reviews — an initial machine canvass, a statewide hand-count
   risk-limiting audit (the first full hand count of a presidential race in Georgia
   history), and a second machine recount requested by the Trump campaign — before
   Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger certified the result on November 20, 2020.
   Federal and state court challenges were rejected on standing and procedural grounds
   (*Wood v. Raffensperger*, No. 20-14418, 11th Cir. 2020; *Pearson v. Kemp*, N.D. Ga.
   2020). On January 2, 2021, President Trump called Raffensperger requesting he "find
   11,780 votes"; the call was recorded and released publicly. Congress certified
   Georgia's electoral votes on January 7, 2021, after proceedings were disrupted and
   resumed. [Observed — source: Georgia SoS, 2020 General Election certification records;
   *Wood v. Raffensperger*, No. 20-14418 (11th Cir. 2020); Georgia SoS, transcript of
   January 2, 2021 call, released January 3, 2021]

4. **Evidence** — County canvass minutes, state canvass certificates, audit reports,
   and court opinions resolving post‑certification challenges.

5. **Levers** — Strengthening post‑election audit mandates, harmonizing deadlines across
   statutes, and clarifying statutory certification authority reduce ambiguity and
   litigation risk. [Inferred]

6. **Takeaway** — Certification is the final administrative step that makes local counts
   legally operative at the state and federal levels; the quality of audits, the clarity
   of statutory roles, and the speed of adjudication determine whether certification
   produces a stable public record. [Observed]
