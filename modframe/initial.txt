Here’s a clean, portable summary prompt you can use to restart this conversation in a new thread while preserving the strategic depth:

**Summary Prompt:**

I want to explore building a modular, evergreen political media framework called (working title) “The Structural Activation Model.”

Core idea:

Create a publicly hosted, open-concept library of neutral, institutional explainers about how political power structures actually function (campaign finance, committee power, regulatory capture, judicial pathways, executive authority, etc.). These would be evergreen, citation-heavy, visually modular, and platform-neutral.

When political scandals or major events arise, media outlets (or the project itself) can “activate” the relevant structural framework and layer in the current event — shifting coverage from reactive outrage to systemic pattern recognition.

The long-term goal is not to tailor this to any one personality or network, but to:

1. Establish widely adopted structural language and frameworks.
2. Become a reference standard for journalists and analysts.
3. Increase leverage by defining how institutional dysfunction is measured and discussed.
4. Potentially evolve into a cross-ideological accountability infrastructure.

Key questions to explore:

* How should the concept be framed to be irresistible to media outlets?
* What would the minimum viable version look like?
* How do we prevent ideological capture while maintaining clarity?
* What’s the optimal sequencing from launch to influence?
* What structural governance would preserve legitimacy?
* What metrics would indicate real leverage vs. superficial traction?

I want rigorous strategic analysis — not surface-level media advice.

If you'd like, I can also give you:

* A more concise version (under 150 words)
* A sharper investor-facing version
* Or a reform-oriented version designed for civic institutions
