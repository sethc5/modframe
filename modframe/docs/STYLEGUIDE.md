# Style Guide

## Voice

- Institutional and descriptive.
- Prefer “the system incentivizes…” over “they want to…”
- Focus on structures, incentives, and observable constraints.

## Claims

Use one of these explicit claim types:

- **Observed**: supported by a citation.
- **Inferred**: reasoned from observed facts; state assumptions.
- **Hypothesis**: plausible; state what evidence would test it.

## Neutrality constraints

Avoid:
- partisan labels in analysis (“left/right”, “MAGA”, “woke”) unless strictly necessary for describing a formal coalition
- moralizing adjectives (“corrupt”, “evil”) in module text

Allowed:
- describing incentives, conflicts of interest, and accountability gaps
- describing harms with sourced evidence and precise language
