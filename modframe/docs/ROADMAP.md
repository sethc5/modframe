# Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Skeleton ✅

- ~~Confirm section taxonomy~~ → 14 core sections (01–14)
- ~~Standardize module template~~ → see `docs/MODULE_TEMPLATE.md`
- ~~Build validation scripts~~ → `scripts/validate_metadata.py`, `validate_completeness.py`, `build_indexes.py`
- ~~Create content agent pipeline~~ → `docs/CONTENT_AGENT.md` + `docs/prompts/`

## Phase 1 — Core coverage (in progress)

- ~~Build sections 01–07~~ → 147 modules with deep outlines, citations, actor analysis ✅
- Build sections 08–14 → 83 scaffold modules awaiting full build
- Priority order: 08 (Money/Industry) → 11 (Accountability) → 13 (Meta-Incentive) → 09 (Crisis) → 10 (Polarization) → 12 (Foreign Influence) → 14 (Emerging)

## Phase 2 — Quality and cross-referencing

- Add `Related Modules` cross-references across all built modules
- Refresh time-sensitive modules (emergency powers, judicial procedures)
- Add visuals for mechanisms that benefit from diagrams

## Phase 3 — Activation workflows

- Provide "activation packs" for breaking events (which modules to pull, what evidence to request, what visuals to show)

## Phase 4 — Domain expansion

- Build domain-applied sections (see Future Expansion in section map)
- Build financial system deep-dive sections (~380 module ideas absorbed from modframe_wallstreet)

## Phase 5 — External adoption

- Outreach to educators, newsrooms, and researchers
- Encourage reuse under CC BY 4.0
