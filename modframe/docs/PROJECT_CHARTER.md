# Project Charter

## Purpose

A structural and mechanical map of how Washington DC federal government power actually works — where it concentrates, what incentives drive behavior, and what structural features enable or prevent accountability.

14 core sections, 230 modules.

- **17 deep modules** (Section 01) — 150–302 lines with inline statute citations, detailed actor analysis, specific court cases and datasets
- **130 first-draft modules** (Sections 02–07) — all headings filled with real content and claim labels (~58 lines each), awaiting deepening to Section 01 quality
- **83 scaffold modules** (Sections 08–14) — empty templates awaiting full build

## Operating posture

- Nonpartisan / cross-ideological usability
- Institutional tone
- Explicit claim types: `[Observed]`, `[Inferred]`, `[Hypothesis]`
- Primary sources first (statutes, agency records, court opinions, GAO/OIG reports)

## Deliverable

A modular topic library (`topics/`) where each module explains one mechanism of federal power — standalone and composable for "activation" coverage of current events.

## Scope

- **Core (sections 01–14):** Structural mechanics of DC federal power — elections, Congress, executive branch, judiciary, influence, media, states, money, crisis governance, polarization, accountability, foreign influence, meta-incentives, emerging structures
- **Future expansion:** 45 domain-applied federal power sections + 19 financial system deep-dive sections (~380 module ideas)

## Why it matters

Awareness of mechanics is a precursor to accountability. When systems produce outcomes that are unjust to the public, clarity about *where* and *how* power is exercised enables targeted scrutiny and pressure.
