# Modframe — Structural Activation Model

A free-to-use, nonpartisan library of modular explainers describing the *mechanics* of political power in Washington, DC (and adjacent systems).

The intent is to map major levers of power (formal and informal), describe their incentive structures, and provide reusable modules that help the public, journalists, educators, and analysts see how outcomes are produced—so awareness can precede scrutiny, pressure, and reform when systems operate unjustly.

## What this repository contains

- `topics/` — the skeletal map: one folder per section, containing topic modules
- `interactive_example.ipynb` — a lightweight notebook used for examples and smoke checks
- `docs/` — contribution standards, module template, governance, and style constraints

## How to use this

- Browse `topics/` by section number.
- Each topic module should contain:
  - `README.md` (what this module is)
  - `outline.md` (structured explainer outline + source targets)
  - optional `figures/` for visuals

## Principles

- **Neutral / institutional voice**: explain structures and incentives, not personalities.
- **Citation-forward**: claims should be traceable to primary sources where possible.
- **Composable modules**: topics should stand alone and also plug into “activation” coverage of current events.
- **Cross-ideological usability**: make the mechanics legible to people across the aisle.
