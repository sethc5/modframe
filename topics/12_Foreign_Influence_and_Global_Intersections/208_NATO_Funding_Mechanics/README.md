# NATO Funding Mechanics

Purpose: Explains how NATO's tripartite funding structure — common civil and military budgets, national defense spending, and the 2% GDP target — creates a persistent burden-sharing political dynamic that does not threaten the Article 5 legal commitment but creates alliance uncertainty when exploited as a conditionality lever.
