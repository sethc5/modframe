Purpose: Explains how the structural gap between the outdated Foreign Assistance Act authorization framework and annual State-Foreign Operations appropriations concentrates foreign aid implementation authority in the executive branch, allowing successive administrations to withhold, reprogram, and condition congressionally-appropriated aid based on presidential foreign policy preferences.
