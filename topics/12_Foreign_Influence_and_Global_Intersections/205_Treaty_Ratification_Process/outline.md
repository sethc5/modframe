# Treaty Ratification Process

**Summary:** Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution requires Senate approval of treaties by a two-thirds supermajority, creating a ratification threshold that has driven the executive branch to increasingly rely on executive agreements — congressional-executive agreements approved by simple majority or purely executive agreements requiring no congressional approval — as functional alternatives that can achieve the same international commitments without the two-thirds bar. [Observed] The United States is party to thousands of active executive agreements and fewer than 1,000 Senate-ratified treaties; major international commitments including international trade agreements (approved under TPA as congressional-executive agreements), climate accords (Paris Agreement as executive agreement), and intelligence-sharing arrangements (Five Eyes as purely executive) have been made through non-treaty mechanisms. [Observed] This substitution has reduced Senate leverage over international commitments while concentrating international agreement authority in the executive branch, where agreements can be entered and withdrawn without the durability that Senate ratification would provide. [Inferred] The structural result is a treaty system where the constitutional two-thirds requirement has been negotiated around rather than abolished — giving the executive branch flexibility to make international commitments that outlast a single administration only when the Senate independently chooses to ratify. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** The Article II two-thirds treaty ratification requirement has driven systematic substitution of executive agreements for formal treaties, concentrating international commitment authority in the executive branch while reducing the durability and Senate accountability of major international agreements. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **President and Secretary of State** — negotiate and sign both treaties (submitted for Senate advice and consent) and executive agreements (not submitted); determine the legal instrument for each international commitment. [Observed]
- **Senate Foreign Relations Committee** — receives treaty referrals, holds hearings, and votes on resolutions of ratification; has significant agenda-setting power over which treaties advance to the floor. [Observed]
- **Full Senate** — votes on resolution of ratification by two-thirds present and voting; can attach conditions/reservations; can indefinitely defer treaties without rejecting them. [Observed]
- **State Department Office of the Legal Adviser** — determines whether a new agreement should be classified as a treaty or executive agreement under the Case-Zablocki Act standards. [Observed]
- **Congressional Research Service** — documents treaty and executive agreement volume; provides Congress analysis of the treaty vs. executive agreement substitution. [Observed]
- **International partners** — often prefer treaty-level commitments from the U.S. for durability; executive agreement reversibility (Paris Agreement withdrawal, JCPOA withdrawal) has damaged U.S. credibility on international commitments. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- The executive branch negotiates an international agreement; the State Department Legal Adviser and NSC attorney determine whether to designate it a treaty (requiring Senate consent) or an executive agreement. [Observed]
- If designated an executive agreement, it enters into force without Senate vote; the Case-Zablocki Act (1972) requires the executive to notify Congress of executive agreements within 60 days, but notification is not approval. [Observed]
- If designated a treaty, it is transmitted to the Senate for advice and consent; the Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds hearings and reports a resolution of ratification, which may include conditions. [Observed]
- The full Senate votes; two-thirds of senators present and voting must approve; the threshold effectively requires substantial bipartisan support in a polarized Senate. [Observed]
- If approved, the President ratifies and exchanges instruments with the treaty partner; the treaty enters U.S. domestic law as equivalent to federal statute (later-in-time rule applies between treaties and federal statutes). [Observed]
- Treaties that have been submitted but neither approved nor rejected can remain pending on the Senate calendar indefinitely; dozens of treaties have been pending for decades. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** The executive branch determination of treaty vs. executive agreement classification is the critical gatekeeping decision; it is made by the State Department Legal Adviser without any formal congressional approval role, and courts have given the executive branch broad deference. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship controls the treaty calendar; individual senators can place holds on treaty ratification; the two-thirds threshold requires bipartisan coalition-building that the executive branch avoids by using executive agreements. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** The one-third-plus-one blocking threshold in the Senate gives a determined minority (34 senators from small states representing a fraction of the U.S. population) veto power over treaty ratification. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Major international commitments made as executive agreements lack the durability of treaties; the Paris Agreement was entered (Obama) and withdrawn (Trump) and re-entered (Biden) without any change in Senate approval — a durability failure with significant international credibility costs. [Observed]
- The treaty vs. executive agreement classification determination lacks a clear standard or judicial review mechanism; the executive branch has broad discretion that has been used to avoid ratification requirements. [Observed]
- Pending treaties on the Senate calendar include UNCLOS (submitted 1994, never ratified), the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (submitted 1997, rejected 1999), and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (submitted 2012, rejected 2012; resubmitted, never ratified) — demonstrating the Senate's prolonged blocking capacity. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- State Department office of the Legal Adviser reports on executive agreements (Circular 175 procedure) document the decisional standards applied. [Observed]
- Congressional Research Service analysis of treaty vs. executive agreement volume trends. [Observed]
- Case-Zablocki Act notifications published in the Federal Register document executive agreement volume. [Observed]
- Compare U.S. treaty ratification rate with peer democracies (UK, Germany, France, Japan) to assess whether the U.S. two-thirds bar is an outlier. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the constitutional treaty ratification process, the executive agreement alternatives (congressional-executive vs. purely executive), Case-Zablocki Act notification, and the Senate pending treaty calendar. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain the executive branch preference for executive agreements: avoids 34-senator veto, faster, more reversible, avoids Senate condition-attachment authority. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace the Paris Agreement lifecycle — executive agreement entry, withdrawal, re-entry — as a demonstration of executive agreement reversibility and the international credibility cost of treaty substitution. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present treaty vs. executive agreement volume data; document the pending treaty calendar; compare U.S. major international commitments (climate, arms control, trade) by legal instrument type and durability. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate statutory standards for treaty vs. executive agreement classification, mandatory Senate action timelines for submitted treaties, and a congressional-executive agreement process for trade agreements as a middle path on durability. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The constitutional two-thirds treaty ratification requirement has been systematically negotiated around through executive agreement substitution, concentrating international commitment authority in the executive branch and producing an international legal posture where major U.S. commitments are reversible by presidential action alone rather than durable through Senate ratification.
