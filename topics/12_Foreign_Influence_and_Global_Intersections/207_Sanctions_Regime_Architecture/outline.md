# Sanctions Regime Architecture

**Summary:** U.S. sanctions — administered primarily through the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) — are one of the most powerful foreign policy tools available to the executive branch, allowing asset freezes, transaction prohibitions, and market exclusions to be imposed on foreign governments, entities, and individuals without congressional approval. [Observed] OFAC administers over 30 active sanctions programs, drawing authority from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), executive orders, and specific country sanctions statutes; the President can activate IEEPA sanctions by declaring a national emergency, providing near-unilateral authority to impose economic coercion on any foreign actor. [Observed] Sanctions have evolved from country-specific blockade instruments into targeted ("smart") sanctions against designated individuals and entities on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, but secondary sanctions — which penalize third-country entities for transacting with sanctioned parties — have emerged as the most extraterritorial and legally contested tool, limiting market access for non-U.S. entities that have no other connection to U.S. territory. [Observed] The structural result is an executive foreign policy tool of extraordinary scope with minimal ex ante congressional involvement, significant extraterritorial reach, and substantial consequences for U.S. financial system centrality in the global economy if overused. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** OFAC sanctions convert U.S. financial system centrality and dollar dominance into coercive foreign policy instruments that the executive can deploy unilaterally under IEEPA authority, impose on non-U.S. entities through secondary sanctions, and maintain indefinitely without regular congressional reauthorization. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, Treasury)** — administers all U.S. sanctions programs; issues SDN designations, general licenses, specific licenses, and OFAC guidance; processes compliance inquiries from financial institutions. [Observed]
- **Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence** — oversees OFAC and Treasury's financial intelligence function; coordinates sanctions policy with NSC, State, and Commerce. [Observed]
- **National Security Council** — coordinates sanctions strategy as an NSC-level foreign policy tool; approves significant new designations through interagency process. [Observed]
- **Department of State** — administers some country-specific sanctions authorities; coordinates diplomatic messaging around sanctions designations; issues terrorist designation under AEDPA. [Observed]
- **Department of Justice** — prosecutes criminal IEEPA and OFAC sanction violations; coordinates enforcement with OFAC civil penalties. [Observed]
- **Global financial institutions** — implement sanctions compliance as a condition of U.S. dollar correspondent banking access; over-compliance (de-risking) has become a significant policy concern. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- The executive branch identifies a foreign policy objective (deterring malign state behavior, countering terrorism financing, pressuring nuclear proliferators) that sanctions could advance. [Observed]
- IEEPA activation: President declares a national emergency with respect to an unusual and extraordinary foreign threat; IEEPA then authorizes OFAC to block assets and prohibit transactions. [Observed]
- OFAC issues implementing regulations for the sanctions program and maintains the SDN list; new individual/entity designations are added through an interagency evidence-gathering process. [Observed]
- Secondary sanctions: OFAC may issue rules penalizing non-U.S. entities for transacting with sanctioned parties, even if the transactions have no U.S. nexus; enforced through correspondent banking access threats. [Observed]
- Licensing: OFAC issues general licenses (categorical exemptions) and specific licenses (individual authorizations) that allow otherwise prohibited transactions for humanitarian, diplomatic, or business reasons. [Observed]
- Congressional involvement is limited: Congress can legislate mandatory sanctions (as in the Iran Sanctions Act, CAATSA), designate sanctions criteria, or limit presidential waiver authority; but most programs run under IEEPA with annual national emergency renewals. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** The OFAC Director and Treasury Under Secretary control the SDN designation process and licensing decisions; their determinations are subject to administrative challenge but the substantive standard for designation is deferential and national security-adjacent. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** U.S. dollar correspondent banking access is the enforcement mechanism for secondary sanctions; non-U.S. banks that transact with sanctioned entities risk losing U.S. dollar clearing access, creating compliance incentives far beyond OFAC's formal enforcement reach. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Congress can legislate mandatory sanctions that restrict presidential waiver authority (as in the Iran Sanctions Act and CAATSA), reducing executive flexibility; this has been the primary congressional check on executive sanctions policy. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Sanction overuse risks dollar weaponization backlash: China, Russia, and other states have accelerated development of dollar-alternative payment systems (CIPS, SPFS) and bilateral trade settlement mechanisms that reduce U.S. leverage over time. [Observed]
- Over-compliance by financial institutions ("de-risking") means that OFAC sanctions effectively cut off entire geographic markets — including legitimate commerce — beyond what OFAC's formal SDN designations require. [Observed]
- The IEEPA emergency renewal mechanism — which requires presidential renewal of national emergencies under IEEPA every year — has become a formality for long-running programs like Iran sanctions; the emergency declaration mechanism is legally required but substantively perfunctory. [Observed]
- Secondary sanctions extraterritorial reach regularly creates transatlantic legal conflict (EU blocking statute) and undermines multilateral coordination on sanctions policy. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- OFAC annual report documents active sanctions programs, SDN designations, civil penalties, and licensing actions. [Observed]
- National emergency declarations and IEEPA renewal records (Federal Register) document the legal basis and longevity of active programs. [Observed]
- Financial Stability Oversight Council and BIS research on de-risking and correspondent banking withdrawal trends. [Observed]
- Compare sanctions coercive effectiveness: Iran nuclear JCPOA (2015) as partial success case; North Korea as case of limited effectiveness despite comprehensive sanctions. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the sanctions architecture — IEEPA authority, OFAC administration, SDN designations, secondary sanctions, licensing system, and congressional overlay authorities (Iran Sanctions Act, CAATSA). [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why sanctions have become the preferred executive foreign policy tool: they can be deployed without congressional approval, are more precise than military options, and leverage U.S. financial system centrality without deploying force. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace the Russia CAATSA sanctions (2017) — legislative mandatory sanctions constraining executive waiver authority as a case study in congressional effort to limit presidential sanctions discretion. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present OFAC annual data on active programs, SDN designations, and civil penalties; document de-risking research; assess Iran, North Korea, and Russia as case studies of sanctions coercive effectiveness variance. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate mandatory congressional approval for new IEEPA programs beyond initial emergency period, sunset provisions requiring active reauthorization, and multilateral coordination requirements before secondary sanctions activation. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** OFAC sanctions convert U.S. financial system centrality into an executive foreign policy instrument of exceptional power available without congressional approval — but the accumulation of sanctions programs, the expansion of secondary sanctions extraterritorial reach, and the risk of dollar weaponization backlash represent long-run structural costs to the same dollar dominance that makes sanctions effective. [Inferred]
