# Sanctions Regime Architecture

Purpose: Explains how OFAC sanctions convert U.S. financial system centrality into executive foreign policy instruments deployable without congressional approval under IEEPA authority, how secondary sanctions extend U.S. coercive reach to non-U.S. entities, and the structural risk that sanction overuse poses to the dollar dominance that makes sanctions effective.
