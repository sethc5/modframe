# Banking Regulatory Enforcement Layers

**Summary:** The United States regulates banks through a uniquely fragmented system in which multiple federal agencies and 50 state regulators exercise overlapping supervisory and enforcement authority over the same industry. [Observed] The primary federal banking regulators — the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) — each possess independent enforcement powers including cease-and-desist authority, civil money penalties, removal and prohibition orders against individuals, and referral authority for criminal prosecution. [Observed] This multi-layer system was not designed; it accumulated through 150 years of legislative responses to successive banking crises, producing a regulatory structure where a single bank may be supervised by three or more federal agencies simultaneously. [Observed] The fragmentation creates both redundancy (multiple agencies may investigate the same conduct) and gaps (agencies may each assume another is taking action), while the "dual banking system" allows institutions to choose between state and federal charters — and effectively to select their primary federal regulator — creating competitive pressure among regulators to attract and retain charters through lighter supervision. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Bank regulatory enforcement operates through overlapping federal and state agencies with independent enforcement powers, where charter choice and regulatory competition create structural incentives for lenient supervision while fragmentation produces both redundant and gap-ridden oversight. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)** — charters, supervises, and enforces regulations for national banks and federal savings associations (~1,000 institutions holding approximately two-thirds of U.S. banking assets). [Observed] Incentive: maintain the attractiveness of the national bank charter (funded by assessments from supervised banks). Constraint: must balance charter competition with supervisory credibility. [Observed — source: 12 U.S.C. §§ 1-200]
- **Federal Reserve** — supervises bank holding companies (BHCs), state-chartered member banks, and systemically important financial institutions; exercises consolidated supervisory authority over BHCs that own national banks supervised at the bank level by the OCC. [Observed] Incentive: financial stability and monetary policy transmission. Constraint: supervisory authority shared with other agencies; enforcement actions may affect monetary policy conditions. [Observed — source: 12 U.S.C. § 1844 (BHC Act)]
- **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)** — supervises state-chartered banks that are not Federal Reserve members (~3,500 institutions); operates the Deposit Insurance Fund and serves as receiver for failed banks. [Observed] Incentive: protect the DIF from losses. Constraint: must balance insurance fund protection with bank viability. [Observed — source: 12 U.S.C. §§ 1811-1835a]
- **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** — exercises supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services at banks with assets over $10 billion and at nonbank financial companies. [Observed] Incentive: consumer protection. Constraint: political vulnerability (single-director structure subject to presidential removal; funding contested by industry). [Observed — source: 12 U.S.C. §§ 5491-5603]
- **State banking regulators (50 states + DC and territories)** — charter and supervise state-chartered banks; enforce state consumer protection and banking laws; coordinate through the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS). [Observed] Incentive: maintain viability of the state charter and state-level regulatory authority. Constraint: resource limitations relative to federal agencies. [Observed]
- **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)** — administers the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations; delegates day-to-day BSA/AML examination to the primary federal banking regulators but retains independent enforcement authority. [Observed — source: 31 U.S.C. § 5311 et seq.]
- **Department of Justice (DOJ)** — prosecutes criminal violations of banking laws (bank fraud, BSA/AML violations, sanctions evasion); receives criminal referrals from banking regulators. [Observed] The DOJ's involvement depends on regulatory referrals, creating a pipeline where frontline oversight agencies control criminal prosecution input. [Observed]
- **Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)** — interagency body that prescribes uniform examination standards and reporting requirements; coordinates but does not direct individual agency enforcement. [Observed — source: 12 U.S.C. § 3301]

### Process map (bulleted)

- Each bank has a "primary federal regulator" determined by its charter type and Federal Reserve membership status: national banks → OCC; state member banks → Fed; state nonmember insured banks → FDIC. [Observed]
- The primary federal regulator conducts regularly scheduled examinations (on-site and off-site) on a 12- or 18-month cycle (depending on asset size and condition), assessing safety and soundness, compliance, BSA/AML, and consumer protection (for banks under $10B; CFPB handles consumer for banks over $10B). [Observed — source: 12 U.S.C. § 1820(d)]
- Examiners assign CAMELS ratings (Capital, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, Sensitivity to market risk) on a 1-5 scale; ratings are confidential and determine the intensity of subsequent supervision. [Observed]
- When violations or unsafe practices are identified, the primary regulator may pursue informal enforcement actions (memoranda of understanding, board resolutions, commitment letters) that are not publicly disclosed. [Observed]
- For more serious violations, the regulator may issue formal enforcement actions: consent orders, cease-and-desist orders (12 U.S.C. § 1818(b)), civil money penalties (12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)), removal and prohibition orders against individuals (12 U.S.C. § 1818(e)), and safety-and-soundness orders. [Observed]
- Formal enforcement actions are publicly disclosed and published on agency websites; informal actions are generally not disclosed, creating a transparency gap in which the most common supervisory responses are invisible to the public. [Observed]
- For BHCs: the Federal Reserve exercises consolidated supervision and enforcement at the holding company level, even when the OCC or FDIC is the primary regulator of subsidiary banks. [Observed] This creates potential jurisdictional tension when the holding company regulator (Fed) and bank regulator (OCC or FDIC) disagree on supervisory approach. [Inferred]
- For BSA/AML: the primary bank regulator examines compliance and may pursue enforcement, but FinCEN retains independent enforcement authority and can pursue parallel actions; DOJ can prosecute criminal violations based on regulatory referrals. [Observed]
- For consumer protection (banks over $10B): CFPB conducts examinations and enforcement actions independently of the primary prudential regulator, creating a dual examination burden and potential conflicting supervisory expectations. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** The primary federal regulator's examination team determines the CAMELS rating, which drives supervisory intensity; the decision to escalate from informal to formal enforcement is made by the regulator's supervision committee, creating an internal choke point where most violations are resolved quietly. [Observed] The vast majority of supervisory concerns are addressed through informal actions that never become public. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Criminal prosecution of banking violations depends on DOJ willingness to pursue cases referred by banking regulators; DOJ's "Too Big to Jail" pattern of the 2008-2015 era demonstrated that criminal referrals for the largest institutions were rarely pursued, with deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) and non-prosecution agreements (NPAs) substituting for criminal prosecution. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Charter conversion allows banks to switch between state and federal charters and effectively change their primary regulator; this is the structural mechanism for regulatory competition. [Observed] Congressional oversight committees can pressure agencies to soften or strengthen enforcement through hearings, appropriations, and nominee confirmation processes. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- **Regulatory competition (race to the bottom):** The ability to switch charters creates competitive pressure among regulators to attract institutions through less burdensome supervision; the OCC's pre-2008 preemption of state consumer protection laws and the OTS's permissive supervision of thrifts (including AIG's thrift subsidiary and Washington Mutual) are canonical examples. [Observed]
- **Informal action opacity:** The preference for informal enforcement (MOU, board resolution) over formal public actions means that the public and Congress lack visibility into the most common supervisory responses; banks under informal enforcement can appear to be in good standing. [Observed]
- **Coordination failure:** Multiple agencies with overlapping jurisdiction may each assume another is addressing a problem; the pre-2008 failure to supervise AIG's Financial Products unit occurred in part because no single regulator had clear responsibility for the holding company's derivatives activity. [Observed]
- **Penalty inadequacy:** Civil money penalties for the largest banks are frequently a small fraction of the revenue generated by the violating conduct; penalties function as a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent. [Observed] Wells Fargo's fake accounts scandal generated initial penalties that represented less than one day of the bank's revenue. [Observed]
- **Revolving door capture:** Examiners and senior supervisory officials frequently move to the institutions they previously supervised, creating relationships that may soften enforcement during their regulatory tenure. [Observed — see module 048 et seq.]
- **BSA/AML theater:** Banks invest heavily in BSA/AML compliance infrastructure (suspicious activity reports, transaction monitoring) that generates enormous volumes of filings (~4 million SARs annually) but limited actual enforcement against financial crime, suggesting a compliance-over-effectiveness orientation. [Inferred — the SAR-to-prosecution ratio is extremely low]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Track charter conversions (state-to-federal, federal-to-state) and correlate with enforcement intensity at the origin regulator to test regulatory competition effects. [Inferred — source: OCC, FDIC charter conversion data]
- Compare formal vs. informal enforcement action ratios across agencies and over time. [Observed — source: agency enforcement action databases]
- Analyze civil money penalty amounts relative to the revenue from the violating conduct and to bank earnings to test the "cost of doing business" thesis. [Observed — source: agency enforcement data, bank earnings reports]
- Track examiner-to-industry career transitions and correlate with enforcement stringency during their regulatory tenure. [Inferred]
- Compare SAR filing volumes with subsequent criminal prosecutions to assess BSA/AML effectiveness. [Observed — source: FinCEN SAR statistics, DOJ prosecution data]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the multi-agency enforcement architecture — OCC, Fed, FDIC, CFPB, FinCEN, state regulators — showing how charter type determines primary regulator assignment, how examination cycles generate supervisory findings, and how the enforcement escalation ladder (informal → formal → criminal referral) creates a pipeline that narrows dramatically at each stage. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain regulation competition and its consequences: charter choice creates competitive pressure among regulators; assessment-funded agencies (OCC, FDIC) have revenue dependence on the institutions they supervise; congressional pressure on enforcement intensity fluctuates with political cycles; and the revolving door creates relational softening of supervision. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace the Wells Fargo fake accounts enforcement timeline — from early supervisory warnings (2011-2013), through internal escalation failures, OCC's initial penalty ($185 million across agencies, September 2016), subsequent $3 billion DOJ/SEC consent order (2020), and the unprecedented Fed asset cap (2018) — demonstrating how multi-agency fragmentation produced delayed, fragmented, and initially inadequate enforcement against the third-largest U.S. bank. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present enforcement action volume and penalty trends across agencies, formal vs. informal action ratios, charter conversion data, SAR filing volumes vs. prosecution rates, examiner-to-industry career transition data, and CAMELS rating distributions. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate consolidating banking supervision into a single federal regulator (eliminating regulatory arbitrage); requiring public disclosure of all supervisory actions (eliminating the informal action opacity); linking penalty amounts to revenue from violating conduct; mandatory examiner cooling-off periods; and restructuring agency funding to eliminate assessment dependence on supervised institutions. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** U.S. banking enforcement is not a coherent system but an accumulation of overlapping authorities that produces regulatory competition, enforcement opacity, and penalty inadequacy for the largest institutions — a structure where the complexity that makes banks difficult to regulate also makes the regulatory system itself difficult for the public or Congress to understand, creating a self-reinforcing legibility problem. [Inferred]
