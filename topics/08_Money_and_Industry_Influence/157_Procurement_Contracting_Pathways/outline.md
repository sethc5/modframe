# Procurement Contracting Pathways

**Summary:** Federal procurement is the mechanism through which the U.S. government spends roughly $700 billion annually on contracts for goods, services, and construction, making it one of the largest single sources of private-sector revenue in the world. [Observed] The procurement system is governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and agency-specific supplements, administered by contracting officers who hold unique legal authority to bind the government to contractual obligations. [Observed] Despite the FAR's stated preference for "full and open competition," the majority of federal contract dollars flow through channels that limit or bypass competitive bidding: sole-source awards, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) vehicles, government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs), and task orders under existing contract ceilings that avoid individual competition requirements. [Observed] The system's structural complexity creates information asymmetry between incumbent contractors (who understand the procurement process deeply) and potential new entrants, producing a self-reinforcing incumbency advantage that concentrates contract revenue among a small number of large prime contractors. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Federal procurement routes ~$700 billion annually through a regulatory framework that formally requires competition but structurally favors incumbents through sole-source authorities, IDIQ vehicles, and task ordering mechanisms that reduce competitive pressure on established prime contractors. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Contracting Officers (COs)** — federal employees with warrant authority to obligate government funds through contracts; the only government officials legally authorized to enter into, administer, modify, or terminate contracts. [Observed] Incentive: award contracts efficiently (speed and compliance with FAR), avoid bid protests and audit findings. Constraint: must operate within the FAR's competitive requirements unless specific exceptions apply; personally liable for unauthorized commitments. [Observed — source: FAR Part 1.602]
- **Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP)** — within the Office of Management and Budget, sets government-wide procurement policy, issues FAR guidance, and coordinates acquisition workforce development. [Observed] Incentive: standardize and improve the acquisition system. Constraint: limited enforcement authority; relies on agencies to implement guidance. [Observed — source: 41 U.S.C. § 1101]
- **General Services Administration (GSA)** — administers government-wide contract vehicles including GSA Schedule (now Multiple Award Schedule), GWACs (e.g., Alliant 2, 8(a) STARS III), and the Federal Supply Schedules. [Observed] Incentive: facilitate government purchasing at scale. Constraint: funded by Industrial Funding Fee assessed on contract sales, creating revenue dependence on procurement volume. [Observed]
- **Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)** — administers and oversees Department of Defense contracts after award, including quality assurance, delivery monitoring, and payment processing. [Observed]
- **Prime contractors (top 10)** — Lockheed Martin, RTX (Raytheon), Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, L3Harris, BAE Systems, Leidos, Booz Allen Hamilton, and SAIC collectively receive a disproportionate share of federal contract dollars. [Observed] Incentive: maximize contract value, protect incumbency on recompete vehicles, and expand into adjacent markets. Constraint: subject to cost accounting standards, Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA) disclosure requirements, and OIG audits. [Observed]
- **Small Business Administration (SBA)** — administers set-aside programs (8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business) with government-wide goal of 23% of prime contract dollars to small businesses. [Observed — source: 15 U.S.C. § 644]
- **Government Accountability Office (GAO)** — adjudicates bid protests (deciding approximately 2,500 per year), serving as the primary external check on procurement decisions. [Observed — source: 31 U.S.C. § 3554]
- **Congressional oversight committees** — House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Appropriations subcommittees, and oversight committees exercise control through authorizations, appropriations riders, and hearing-based scrutiny. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- Agencies identify requirements through their mission and program offices; a requirements package is developed specifying what the government needs (performance work statement for services, specifications for goods). [Observed]
- The contracting officer conducts market research to determine available sources and the appropriate acquisition strategy (full and open competition, limited competition, or sole-source). [Observed — source: FAR Part 10]
- For competitive acquisitions above $250,000 (the simplified acquisition threshold), the CO publishes a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation) on SAM.gov, the government's single point of entry for procurement opportunities. [Observed — source: FAR Part 5]
- Offerors submit proposals; an evaluation board scores proposals against stated evaluation criteria (typically technical capability, past performance, and price). [Observed — source: FAR Part 15]
- The CO selects the awardee based on "best value" (considering technical and price factors) or "lowest price technically acceptable" (LPTA); the CO documents the rationale in a source selection decision document. [Observed]
- Unsuccessful offerors may file bid protests with the agency, GAO, or the Court of Federal Claims; protest rates are approximately 2-4% of eligible actions but substantially higher for large contracts. [Observed]
- For IDIQ contracts (the dominant vehicle for services): a master contract is competitively awarded to multiple vendors, who then compete for individual task orders issued under the contract ceiling; this competition is typically limited to the pool of contract holders and may involve simplified evaluation procedures. [Observed — source: FAR Part 16.5]
- For sole-source acquisitions, the CO must justify the noncompetitive approach through a Justification and Approval (J&A) document citing one of seven statutory exceptions (e.g., only one responsible source, unusual and compelling urgency, national security). [Observed — source: FAR Part 6.3; 10 U.S.C. § 3204]
- Contract modifications, options, and follow-on awards can substantially expand the value and duration of contracts beyond the original competitive award, often without requiring additional competition. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Contracting officers with warrant authority are the exclusive gatekeepers for federal spending through contracts; their determination of acquisition strategy (competitive vs. sole-source, evaluation criteria, contract type) shapes which firms can win. [Observed] Program managers who write requirements influence outcomes by specifying needs that only incumbent contractors or specific firms can meet. [Inferred]
- **Bottlenecks:** IDIQ contract vehicle pre-qualification creates a two-stage competition: firms must first win a spot on the vehicle (competing against many), then compete for task orders (competing against a smaller pool); firms not on the vehicle are excluded entirely from task order competition. [Observed] The FAR itself is over 2,000 pages and produces procedural complexity that advantages large firms with dedicated proposal and compliance teams. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** GAO bid protests can delay or overturn awards; the Court of Federal Claims provides an alternative protest forum. [Observed] Congressional notification requirements for large contracts (over $100 million) create political oversight but also enable congressional interference on behalf of constituent contractors. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- **Incumbency lock-in:** Past performance evaluation criteria systematically advantage incumbents, who have documented government performance records that new entrants lack. [Observed] Organizational conflict of interest rules are insufficient to prevent contractors from writing requirements they subsequently bid on. [Inferred]
- **IDIQ ceiling inflation:** Agencies set IDIQ contract ceilings far above anticipated needs to avoid hitting the ceiling and triggering a new competition; this creates vehicles with billions in ceiling value that can be used to route work without contract-level competition. [Observed]
- **Lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) race to the bottom:** For services contracts evaluated under LPTA, price pressure drives contractors to bid unrealistically low ("buy-in") and then recover costs through contract modifications and change orders. [Observed]
- **Small business pass-through:** Large prime contractors that subcontract to small businesses count the subcontracted work toward small business goals even when the prime captures the majority of the margin; the system meets numerical goals without building genuine small business capacity. [Inferred]
- **Revolving door acceleration:** Government procurement officials who leave for industry carry knowledge of upcoming requirements, evaluation preferences, and agency relationships that provide their new employers with competitive advantage, reinforcing incumbent dominance. [Observed — see also module 048 et seq.]
- **Protest system gaming:** Incumbent contractors may file bid protests against new entrants' wins to delay award and extend their existing contracts through bridge contracts, using the protest process as a competitive weapon rather than a fairness mechanism. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze the percentage of federal contract dollars awarded competitively vs. sole-source or limited competition over time, using FPDS-NG data. [Observed — source: Federal Procurement Data System]
- Measure contract recompete win rates for incumbents vs. new entrants to quantify incumbency advantage. [Inferred]
- Track the ratio of IDIQ contract ceiling values to actual obligations to assess ceiling inflation. [Observed — source: FPDS-NG]
- Evaluate small business prime contracting attainment against SBA goals, disaggregated by direct awards vs. subcontracting pass-through. [Observed — source: SBA Small Business Procurement Scorecard]
- Analyze GAO bid protest outcomes by protester type (incumbent vs. new entrant) and contract value. [Observed — source: GAO annual bid protest reports]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the federal procurement pipeline from requirements generation through solicitation, evaluation, award, and contract administration — identifying the key decision points where competition can be maintained or bypassed, and the legal framework (FAR, DFARS, agency supplements) that governs each stage. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why the procurement system structurally favors incumbents: past performance evaluation criteria, organizational knowledge advantages, IDIQ pre-qualification, procedural complexity that creates barriers to entry, and the CO's risk-minimizing incentive to award to known performers. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a major IDIQ vehicle (e.g., GSA Alliant 2, CIO-SP3, or OASIS+) from initial competition through task order issuance, showing how a single contract vehicle creates a competitive oligopoly among pre-qualified firms and routes billions in spending through simplified competition among a small pool. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present FPDS-NG data on competitive vs. noncompetitive spending, prime contractor concentration (top 10 and top 100 share of total spending), small business goal attainment and pass-through rates, bid protest volume and outcome trends, and IDIQ utilization rates. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate procurement reforms: expanding simplified acquisition procedures for smaller purchases to reduce overhead; requiring price transparency for IDIQ task orders; strengthening organizational conflict of interest rules; increasing CO workforce capacity and warrant authority; mandating post-award debriefs that enable new entrants to improve; and reducing revolving door advantages through longer cooling-off periods for procurement officials. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Federal procurement's formal commitment to competition coexists with structural mechanisms — IDIQ vehicles, past performance advantages, procedural complexity, and revolving door dynamics — that concentrate hundreds of billions in annual spending among a small number of prime contractors, making the procurement system one of the most powerful but least visible channels for industry influence on government operations. [Inferred]
