Purpose: Explains why there is no federal agency with jurisdiction over political misinformation content, how First Amendment doctrine and regulatory fragmentation limit available governance tools, and what state-level and platform-level responses have emerged to fill the gap.

Status: draft

Tags: misinformation, First Amendment, FEC, FCC, AI deepfakes, elections, platforms, content moderation

Key actors:
- Federal Election Commission (FEC) — jurisdiction over campaign finance, not content
- Federal Communications Commission (FCC) — broadcasting, not internet content
- Department of Justice (DOJ) — election interference and AI-generated robocall enforcement
- Platform trust and safety teams (Meta, Google, X)
- State Attorneys General and election officials
- Academic and civil society misinformation researchers (Stanford Internet Observatory, DFRLab)

Statutes and authorities:
- First Amendment, U.S. Constitution (central limit on content regulation)
- Federal Election Campaign Act, 52 U.S.C. § 30101 et seq. (FEC jurisdiction over paid advertising disclosure, not content)
- Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. § 227 (FCC robocall authority)
- Communications Decency Act, § 230 (platform liability shield)
- State laws on AI-generated political deepfakes (California AB 2839, Texas SB 751, others)

Case studies:
- New Hampshire Biden AI robocall (January 2024) — DOJ prosecution under TCPA
- FEC's failure to adopt AI/deepfake disclosure rule (2023 NPRM)
- Stanford Internet Observatory and CISA election integrity coordination (subsequent controversy, 2023)

Data sources:
- FEC advisory opinions and enforcement records
- FCC enforcement actions for robocall violations
- NCSL tracker of state AI deepfake laws
- DFRLab (Digital Forensic Research Lab) influence operation reporting
