# Intersectional Policy Impact Mapping

**Summary:** Federal regulatory and legislative processes do not systematically analyze how policies affect populations defined by multiple overlapping characteristics — race, income, geography, disability, gender, and immigration status in combination — leaving structural blind spots in equity analysis that allow disparate impacts to persist without triggering legal or political accountability. [Observed] OMB's regulatory analysis standards (Circular A-4) require cost-benefit analysis with distributional effects, but the distributional analysis typically examines single demographic dimensions rather than intersectional combinations — missing populations like low-income disabled rural women of color who may experience compounded policy impacts invisible to single-axis analysis. [Observed] Executive Order 13985 (2021, Biden) directed federal agencies to conduct equity assessments using intersectional approaches, but implementation was methodologically uneven, and the order was rescinded in January 2025. [Observed] The structural result is a policy process in which targeted populations most likely to experience compounded disadvantage are least likely to be captured in standard regulatory impact analysis, creating a systematic accountability gap for cumulative policy harm. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Standard federal regulatory impact analysis examines distributional effects along single demographic dimensions, systematically missing the compounded policy impacts experienced by populations defined by multiple overlapping characteristics. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA, OMB)** — reviews agency regulatory impact analyses under Circular A-4; sets the methodological standards for distributional analysis. [Observed]
- **Federal agency program offices** — implement regulatory impact analysis requirements; methodological capacity for intersectional analysis varies widely across agencies. [Observed]
- **HHS Office of Civil Rights** — enforces civil rights nondiscrimination requirements applicable to HHS programs; reviews complaints but does not ex ante analyze intersectional impact. [Observed]
- **Department of Justice Civil Rights Division** — enforces Title VI, Title IX, and Americans with Disabilities Act in federal programs; case-by-case enforcement rather than systemic impact analysis. [Observed]
- **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)** — scores legislative proposals for fiscal impact; does not routinely produce intersectional demographic distributional analysis. [Observed]
- **Research community and advocacy organizations** — produce intersectional impact analyses that sometimes enter the policy record through notice-and-comment, but participation capacity varies widely across affected communities. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A federal agency proposes a rule or program modification that will affect benefits eligibility, enforcement targeting, or resource allocation. [Observed]
- OIRA review requires a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) under Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4; the RIA must estimate costs and benefits and, since 2023, assess distributional effects. [Observed]
- The distributional analysis is typically conducted along single dimensions (income quintile, racial/ethnic category) rather than at the intersection of multiple characteristics; the methodological tools for intersectional analysis at scale exist but are not standardized. [Observed]
- Notice-and-comment provides an opportunity for affected communities to raise intersectional concerns, but participation is limited by resource constraints, language barriers, and the technical complexity of regulatory proceedings. [Observed]
- The final rule is issued with distributional analysis that may not reveal impacts on multiply-disadvantaged subpopulations; civil rights enforcement is triggered only after documented harm to individual complainants. [Observed]
- Ex post evaluation of program outcomes rarely includes intersectional analysis; program data collection systems may not capture characteristics at the intersection level needed to assess impact. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** OIRA sets the methodological standards for regulatory impact analysis; its Circular A-4 guidance determines what distributional analysis agencies must produce and at what level of disaggregation. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Agency capacity to conduct intersectional impact analysis depends on data collection systems, statistical methods staff, and modeling infrastructure that are unevenly distributed; small agencies may have limited capacity. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** The legal framework for civil rights claims requires plaintiff identification of a protected class facing disparate treatment or impact; intersectional plaintiffs have faced legal uncertainty about whether intersectional claims are cognizable under single-axis statutes. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Program data collection systems often cannot support intersectional analysis because they collect demographic characteristics separately rather than in linked records — a technical infrastructure problem that predates the analytical question. [Observed]
- Intersectional impacts that are statistically significant in aggregate may be invisible in single-axis analysis if the affected population is a small share of any single demographic category. [Inferred]
- Civil rights litigation has produced inconsistent case law on whether intersectional claims (combining race and sex) are cognizable under Title VII or Title VI as distinct claims versus single-axis claims. [Observed]
- The rescission of EO 13985 in 2025 removed the directive requirement for agency equity assessments without providing a statutory baseline; intersectional analysis became discretionary rather than required. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Review a sample of agency regulatory impact analyses for intersectional distributional analysis and compare with OMB Circular A-4 requirements. [Observed]
- Compare post-implementation program outcome data by intersection category for major programs (ACA implementation, COVID-19 relief, SNAP rule changes) to assess disparate impact by intersectional population. [Hypothesis — requires linked administrative data access]
- Review OIRA annual report on regulatory review to assess how frequently distributional analysis is cited as a basis for regulatory modification. [Observed]
- Legal database review of intersectional civil rights claims and case outcomes. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map current federal requirements for regulatory impact analysis and distributional assessment — Circular A-4, EO 12866, CBO scoring — and identify where intersectional analysis would be required, discretionary, or absent. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why single-axis analysis persists: analytical tools for intersectional measurement at scale are relatively new, data systems are not designed for it, and the legal framework developed around single-axis protected classes. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Analyze a specific policy with documented intersectional impact — COVID-19 vaccine distribution or SNAP eligibility rules — showing how single-axis analysis missed cumulative disadvantage for a specific intersectional population. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Review a sample of agency RIAs for intersectional analysis; present research literature on intersectional health or economic outcomes from major federal programs. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate mandatory intersectional distributional analysis requirements in Circular A-4, linked administrative data infrastructure investments, statutory codification of intersectional civil rights claims, and community participatory rulemaking requirements. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The absence of intersectional impact analysis in standard federal regulatory process creates a systematic blind spot for cumulative disadvantage — the populations most likely to experience compounded policy harm are least likely to be captured in the distributional analysis that is supposed to flag those harms. [Inferred]
