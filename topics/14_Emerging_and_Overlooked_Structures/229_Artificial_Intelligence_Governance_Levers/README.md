# Artificial Intelligence Governance Levers

Purpose: Explains why federal AI governance rests primarily on reversible executive orders and voluntary frameworks rather than statute, how EO 14110's rescission in January 2025 demonstrated this durability gap, and what statutory and regulatory levers exist for durable AI governance.

Key actors:
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) / AI Safety Institute (AISI)
- Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
- Office of Management and Budget (OMB, OIRA)
- Federal Trade Commission (FTC) — Section 5 authority
- Sector regulators (FDA, FAA, SEC, CFPB)
- European Commission (EU AI Act enforcement)
- Congress — no comprehensive AI statute enacted

Statutes and authorities:
- Executive Order 14110, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI (October 2023; rescinded January 2025)
- OMB Memorandum M-24-10 (agency AI governance; largely reversed 2025)
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 (January 2023, voluntary)
- FTC Act, § 5, 15 U.S.C. § 45 (unfair or deceptive practices — statutory, persists)
- EU AI Act, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (extraterritorial effect on U.S. firms)
- AI in Government Act of 2020, Pub. L. 116-260, div. U, § 1001

Case studies:
- EO 14110 lifecycle: issuance (October 2023) → NIST AISI creation → January 2025 rescission
- FTC AI enforcement actions under Section 5 (persistent statutory authority)
- EU AI Act as de facto global standard for U.S.-serving AI systems

Data sources:
- GAO AI accountability reports (GAO-24-106811)
- NIST AI Safety Institute publications and post-2025 status
- Federal Register executive order records
