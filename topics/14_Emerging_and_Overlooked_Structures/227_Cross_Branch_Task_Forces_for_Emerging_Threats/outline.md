# Cross-Branch Task Forces for Emerging Threats

**Summary:** When emerging threats — cybersecurity, pandemic preparedness, AI safety, climate infrastructure — span multiple agency jurisdictions and require inter-branch coordination, the executive branch typically responds by creating interagency task forces, working groups, National Security Council sub-committees, or advisory councils that operate outside the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking framework. [Observed] These coordination mechanisms concentrate policy development in executive branch inter-agency processes where the public has no comment right, Congress has no formal approval role, and implementation accountability is diffuse — shared across the participating agencies without clear individual accountability. [Observed] Executive Order 14110 on AI (2023), for instance, created an AI Safety Institute within NIST and a web of interagency implementation requirements, but the structure was designed to be reversible by executive action — and was substantially reversed within the first weeks of the Trump administration in January 2025. [Observed] The structural result is a governance pattern where emerging-threat response is addressed through coordinating mechanisms that can produce sophisticated inter-agency policy quickly, but without the durability, democratic accountability, or enforcement authority that statutory frameworks provide. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Emerging-threat interagency coordination produces sophisticated cross-agency policy through executive mechanisms that lack the durability, democratic accountability, and enforcement authority of statutory frameworks, leaving policy reversible by administrative action alone. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **National Security Council (NSC) interagency process** — coordinates national security emerging-threat policy through deputies committees, principals committees, and sub-committees; operates under the National Security Act of 1947 (statutory basis) but conducts most work through executive-determined procedures. [Observed]
- **Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)** — coordinates emerging technology policy (AI, biotech, quantum) within EOP; advisory role without independent regulatory authority. [Observed]
- **National Economic Council (NEC) and Domestic Policy Council (DPC)** — coordinate domestic policy interagency processes; established by executive order, not statute; entirely reversible by presidential action. [Observed]
- **Office of Management and Budget (OMB)** — coordinates regulatory review and budget allocations that implement interagency task force priorities; OIRA review provides a chokepoint for required regulatory actions. [Observed]
- **Congressional oversight committees** — fund agency programs through appropriations; can legislate statutory frameworks to replace or constrain executive coordination mechanisms; have been slow to act on AI, biosecurity, and climate compared to the pace of executive action. [Observed]
- **Government Accountability Office (GAO)** — audits interagency coordination effectiveness; has documented coordination failures across multiple emerging-threat domains. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- An emerging threat is identified (AI risk, pandemic preparedness gap, critical infrastructure vulnerability) requiring multi-agency response beyond any single agency's jurisdiction. [Observed]
- The White House creates an interagency coordinating mechanism: a working group within the NSC process, a cross-agency task force established by executive order, or a new advisory council. [Observed]
- The task force operates through inter-agency meetings, working-group deliverables, and presidential directives to agencies; public visibility is limited to what is disclosed in executive orders and official reports. [Observed]
- Participating agencies implement task force priorities through their existing statutory authorities; no new statutory authority is typically created, limiting the task force's ability to require action from actors (companies, states) outside the executive branch. [Observed]
- Congressional oversight may occur through hearings and oversight letters; appropriations provide indirect leverage but no direct approval role in task force structure or decisions. [Observed]
- When the administration changes, the task force structure can be dissolved by executive order without congressional action; the inter-agency institutional knowledge accumulated may dissipate unless codified in regulations or guidance. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** The NSC and EOP principals who design the task force structure determine its scope, jurisdiction, and participation rules without public process; the resulting policy development is concentrated in the White House coordination machinery. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** OIRA review of agency regulatory actions required by task force directives provides a chokepoint that can delay or modify implementation; it also provides a mechanism for OMB to shape substantive outcomes. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** The absence of statutory authority means the task force cannot produce binding rules without going through APA rulemaking at the agency level, which is slower, more transparent, and more litigation-exposed. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Executive coordination mechanisms without statutory anchoring are reversible; the Trump administration rescinded EO 14110's AI safety requirements in January 2025 with a single executive order, undoing 18 months of NIST capacity building and interagency implementation. [Observed]
- The APA's public notice-and-comment requirements do not apply to interagency coordination processes, limiting public input and creating accountability gaps. [Observed]
- Diffuse interagency accountability — where responsibility is shared across agencies without a clear lead accountable official — makes post-incident accountability difficult. [Inferred]
- GAO has documented repeated interagency coordination failures in pandemic response, cybersecurity incident response, and supply chain disruption — indicating that task force design persistently underestimates coordination costs. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Executive order and presidential directive archives document the creation, scope, and termination of interagency coordination mechanisms. [Observed]
- GAO reports on interagency coordination effectiveness for specific emerging threats provide systematic evidence of coordination failures. [Observed]
- Compare policy durability across administrations for executive-order-based coordination (AI EO rescission in 2025) vs. statutory frameworks (CISA statutory authority persisted across administration changes). [Observed]
- Congressional Research Service analysis of interagency coordination mechanisms documents which are statutory and which are purely executive. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the interagency coordination architecture — NSC process, EOP councils (NEC, DPC, OSTP), and agency-level working groups — and distinguish those with statutory anchoring from those established by executive order alone. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why executive coordination mechanisms are structurally preferred for emerging threats: they can be created quickly, don't require congressional consensus, and can adapt faster than statutory frameworks. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace EO 14110 (AI safety) from issuance through NIST AI Safety Institute implementation to rescission in January 2025 — as a demonstration of the durability gap between executive and statutory frameworks. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present GAO documentation of interagency coordination failures; compare policy durability across administrations by tracking which mechanisms survived and which were reversed. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate statutory codification of key coordination frameworks, permanent interagency bodies with appropriated budgets that require legislation to dissolve, and mandatory congressional reporting on interagency coordination effectiveness. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Interagency emerging-threat coordination produces sophisticated cross-agency policy that can be created quickly but cannot survive administration change without statutory anchoring — a durability gap that means the U.S. must recapitulate emerging-threat governance capacity with each new administration rather than building on accumulated institutional capability. [Inferred]
