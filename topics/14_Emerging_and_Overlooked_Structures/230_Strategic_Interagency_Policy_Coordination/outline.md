# Strategic Interagency Policy Coordination

**Summary:** The National Security Council (NSC) provides a statutory interagency coordination structure for national security issues, but domestic policy coordination relies on executive-order-created White House offices — the National Economic Council (NEC), Domestic Policy Council (DPC), and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) — that operate without direct statutory authority, making domestic-policy interagency coordination structurally weaker and more susceptible to reorganization than national security coordination. [Observed] The absence of a statutory domestic policy coordination framework has produced recurring coordination failures where major policy challenges (supply chain resilience, pandemic response, infrastructure permitting) fall between agency jurisdictions without a designated lead coordinator with clear authority and accountability. [Observed] The COVID-19 pandemic response illustrated the structural problem acutely: no single federal entity had statutory authority to compel interagency coordination, leading to a fragmented response across HHS, FEMA, DOD, DHS, and CDC with overlapping and sometimes conflicting responsibilities and no clear command structure. [Observed] The result is a federal government whose domestic policy coordination capacity is substantially weaker than its national security coordination capacity — a structural asymmetry that disadvantages domestic crisis response relative to national security crisis response. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Domestic interagency policy coordination relies on executive-created White House offices without statutory authority, producing a coordination architecture weaker and more reversible than the NSC's statutory national security coordination, and prone to gaps when major policy challenges span multiple agency jurisdictions. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **National Security Council (NSC)** — statutory interagency body (National Security Act of 1947); chaired by the President; coordinates national security policy across Defense, State, Treasury, intelligence community, and others; the NSC's Principals Committee provides a decision-making structure with clear authority. [Observed]
- **National Economic Council (NEC)** — established by Executive Order 12835 (1993); coordinates economic policy across Treasury, Commerce, USTR, OMB, and agency principals; no statutory authority separate from the president's. [Observed]
- **Domestic Policy Council (DPC)** — established by Executive Order 12859 (1993); coordinates domestic policy across HHS, HUD, DOT, Labor, and others; no statutory authority; has been reorganized with each administration. [Observed]
- **Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)** — statutory (National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976); provides coordination on science and technology policy. [Observed]
- **Office of Management and Budget (OMB)** — statutory (Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970); provides budget and regulatory review coordination across all agencies; the most powerful and durable interagency coordination mechanism in domestic policy. [Observed]
- **Department/agency heads** — retain their statutory authority and independence; White House coordination offices can convene and align agencies but cannot direct them absent separate statutory authority. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A domestic policy challenge spanning multiple agency jurisdictions is identified (pandemic response, supply chain disruption, infrastructure permitting). [Observed]
- The White House designates a lead coordinator — NEC, DPC, or a newly created task force — through executive direction; the coordinator lacks statutory authority to compel agency action. [Observed]
- The coordinating structure convenes inter-agency working groups; participating agencies retain their independent statutory authorities and may prioritize their own jurisdiction over the coordinating body's guidance. [Observed]
- The absence of a statutory coordinator creates accountability gaps: when coordination fails, responsibility is diffuse across multiple agencies rather than concentrated in an accountable lead. [Inferred]
- Congressional oversight is fragmented across the multiple committees with jurisdiction over participating agencies; no single committee can oversee the coordination structure as a whole. [Observed]
- When the administration changes, the coordinating structure can be reorganized or abolished; the institutional knowledge accumulated dissipates without a statutory framework to preserve it. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** OMB holds the most durable interagency coordination power through budget and regulatory review authority; the OMB Director's ability to allocate resources and review regulations gives them de facto coordination authority exceeding any purely advisory body. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** The lack of statutory authority for NEC and DPC means they can convene but not compel; coordination depends on presidential attention and strong personnel relationships among agency principals, both of which are limited and inconsistent. [Inferred]
- **Veto points:** Agency heads with independent statutory authority can resist White House coordination preferences if they believe their statutory mandate requires different action; most visible in Federal Reserve and independent agency relationships with NEC. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- The NSC's formal tier structure (working groups → deputies committee → principals committee) provides decision accountability that domestic policy coordination bodies typically lack; domestic interagency working groups often have no equivalent escalation mechanism. [Observed]
- COVID-19 response demonstrated the gap: the NSC pandemic preparedness directorate (abolished in 2018) was not reconstituted in time; the domestic response was coordinated through a White House Coronavirus Task Force without statutory authority and with duplicative and conflicting agency mandates. [Observed]
- Infrastructure permitting coordination has historically been the most chronic domestic interagency coordination failure: environmental review, land management, energy siting, and transportation permitting involve different statutes, different agencies, and no coordinating authority with directive power. [Observed]
- Each administration reorganizes the White House coordination structure; the resulting discontinuity means the government must rebuild coordination capacity rather than improving on the prior administration's framework. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare NSC interagency coordination outcomes with DPC/NEC outcomes for equivalent crisis types to measure the structural advantage of statutory vs. executive coordination. [Hypothesis]
- GAO reports on interagency coordination failures for pandemic response, infrastructure permitting, and supply chain provide systematic evidence of the domestic coordination gap. [Observed]
- OMB budget and regulatory coordination records document the scope and effectiveness of OMB as a coordination mechanism. [Observed]
- Congressional Research Service analysis of White House office statutory authority provides the baseline for distinguishing statutory from executive coordination mechanisms. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the White House coordination architecture — NSC (statutory), NEC and DPC (executive order), OMB (statutory), and OSTP (statutory) — distinguishing the legal basis, authority, and durability of each. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why domestic policy coordination is structurally weaker than national security coordination — the NSC's statutory basis, the asymmetric political stakes, and the fragmentation of domestic congressional committee jurisdiction. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace COVID-19 domestic response coordination failure — absence of statutory coordinator, overlapping HHS/FEMA/DOD roles, and the White House Coronavirus Task Force's advisory-only structure — as a demonstration of structural coordination failure. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present GAO reports on pandemic coordination; compare infrastructure permitting timelines to document the chronic interagency coordination deficit in civilian policy domains. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate statutory domestic policy coordination authority (an NSC equivalent for domestic crisis), permanent interagency coordination bodies for identified chronic challenges (permitting, supply chain), and unified congressional oversight mechanisms. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The asymmetry between NSC statutory coordination for national security and executive-only coordination for domestic policy has produced a federal government structurally better equipped to respond to security crises than to domestic ones — a governance design mismatch most visible in precisely the moments when domestic coordination is most urgently needed. [Inferred]
