# Gerrymandering Systems

**Summary:** Gerrymandering uses district-boundary design to shape electoral outcomes by
concentrating or dispersing voters across districts. [Observed] In most states,
redistricting follows the decennial census and is controlled by institutions holding
state-level map-drawing authority at that time. [Observed] Federal courts do not adjudicate
partisan gerrymandering claims under current doctrine, so major remedies are concentrated
in state courts, state constitutional law, and state-level reform structures. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** After each census, map-drawing authorities can redraw
districts so vote geography converts into durable seat advantages across the decade between
redistricting cycles. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **State legislatures** — in most states, hold primary authority to draw congressional
  and state legislative district maps; incentive: draw maps that maximize seats for the
  majority party and protect incumbents; constraint: maps must comply with the Voting
  Rights Act (majority-minority districts), equal population requirements (*Reynolds v.
  Sims*), and, in some states, state constitutional criteria such as compactness and
  contiguity. [Observed — source: U.S. Const. art. I, § 4; Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S.
  533 (1964); 52 U.S.C. § 10301 (Voting Rights Act Section 2)]

- **Governors** — hold veto power over redistricting legislation in most states;
  incentive: block maps unfavorable to their party; constraint: legislature may override
  veto in states that allow it; some states create backup commission or court process if
  governor and legislature deadlock. [Observed — source: state constitutions; NCSL
  redistricting authority survey]

- **Independent and bipartisan redistricting commissions** — established in 14+ states
  by voter initiative or statute; draw maps outside the legislative process; incentive
  varies by commission design; constraint: commission members' selection process
  determines degree of actual independence from party influence. [Observed — source: NCSL
  redistricting commission survey, 2024]

- **State and federal courts** — review redistricting maps for compliance with Voting
  Rights Act, equal population, and state constitutional criteria; after *Rucho* (2019),
  federal courts cannot review partisan gerrymandering; state courts may review under
  state constitutional provisions, and several have struck down maps on state law grounds.

  North Carolina Supreme Court (2022–2023 litigation)]

- **Mapping technologists and consultants** — operationalize redistricting decisions
  using GIS software (ESRI, Maptitude for Redistricting, Dave's Redistricting App);
  sophisticated computing allows simulation of millions of map configurations to
  optimize for partisan outcomes; incentive: serve the hiring party's objectives.
  [Observed — source: redistricting litigation exhibits; Dave's Redistricting App
  documentation]

- **Voters and advocacy organizations** — may challenge maps in state courts or sponsor
  ballot initiatives establishing commissions; incentive: fair representation;
  constraint: legal challenges are costly, slow, and must navigate standing requirements;
  ballot initiatives require majority support in initiative states. [Observed — source:
  state ballot initiative records; Brennan Center litigation tracker]

### Process map (bulleted)

- **Step 1 — Census data release:** The Census Bureau releases redistricting data (PL
  94-171 summary file) following the decennial count; this triggers the legal redistricting
  deadline in most states (typically one year after data release). [Observed — source:
  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 2; 13 U.S.C. § 141(c)]

- **Step 2 — Map drafting:** The controlling party's mapmakers (legislative staff, GIS
  consultants, or commission staff) use redistricting software to test configurations;
  partisan operatives may provide target outcomes (seat projections, efficiency gap
  targets); public hearings may be held but are often advisory only. [Observed — source:
  redistricting litigation exhibits; NCSL public participation requirements]

- **Step 3 — Legislative passage or commission adoption:** Maps are voted on by the
  state legislature (subject to gubernatorial veto in most states) or formally adopted
  by the redistricting commission; in states without a backup mechanism, legislative
  deadlock sends the process to state courts. [Observed — source: state redistricting
  statutes; NCSL redistricting authority survey]

- **Step 4 — Legal challenges:** Affected parties file suit in state and/or federal
  court; federal challenges are limited after *Rucho* to Voting Rights Act and equal
  population claims; state constitutional challenges proceed in state courts; courts
  may impose remedial maps if they find violations. [Observed — source: Rucho v. Common
  Cause (2019); Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301]

- **Step 5 — Map takes effect for the decade:** Absent a court injunction, the enacted
  map governs all elections until the next redistricting cycle; changes to the map
  require either another legislative act or successful litigation; mid-decade
  redistricting has occurred but is less common. [Observed — source: state election
  administration records; Texas 2003 mid-decade redistricting as notable exception]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** The party holding the state legislature majority at the time of
  redistricting effectively controls the district map for the subsequent decade; governors
  with veto power are a secondary check. [Observed — source: NCSL redistricting authority
  data; partisan outcome analyses by Princeton Gerrymandering Project]

- **Bottlenecks:** Redistricting software and data access; the compressed timeline
  between census data release and redistricting deadline limits public scrutiny of draft
  maps; court challenge timelines often extend past the first election under a contested
  map. [Inferred — timeline-as-bottleneck is structural; effects on scrutiny quality are
  inferred from documented patterns]

- **Veto points:** Governors in most states; state courts under state constitutional
  provisions; federal courts for Voting Rights Act claims; voters in initiative states
  who can bypass the legislature to establish commissions. [Observed — source: state
  constitutions; Rucho v. Common Cause (2019)]

### Common failure modes

- **Efficiency gap extremity** — [Observed] Partisan maps can be drawn to create a
  systematic structural advantage measured by the "efficiency gap" — the difference in
  wasted votes between the two parties. Maps with efficiency gaps above 7–8% in one
  party's favor have been associated with durable seat advantages that persist even when
  statewide vote share shifts substantially. [Source: Stephanopoulos and McGhee,
  "Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap," *University of Chicago Law Review*
  (2015); Wisconsin REDMAP analysis]

- **Minority vote dilution** — [Observed] District boundaries can be drawn to "crack"
  minority communities across multiple districts, diluting their collective voting power,
  or "pack" them into a single district to reduce their influence in surrounding
  districts. The Voting Rights Act Section 2 prohibits maps that deny or abridge minority
  voting rights, but litigation is required to enforce it. [Source: 52 U.S.C. § 10301;
  *Allen v. Milligan*, 599 U.S. 1 (2023) (Alabama congressional map)]

- **Court challenge timing lag** — [Inferred] Legal challenges to redistricting maps
  typically take years to resolve. In many cycles, maps are litigated through multiple
  elections before a final ruling — meaning a map found unlawful may govern two or more
  election cycles before a remedy is imposed. This structural lag reduces the deterrent
  effect of judicial review on map-drawing decisions.

- **Commission capture** — [Hypothesis] Redistricting commissions are structurally
  designed to reduce partisan influence, but commission member selection processes vary
  widely. Where party leaders select commission members directly, commissions may reflect
  party preferences rather than independent judgment. Comparative research on commission
  vs. legislative outcomes would test whether commission maps are systematically less
  partisan.

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Efficiency gap calculations applied to enacted maps across states would quantify
  partisan bias and allow comparison across redistricting methods (commission vs.
  legislative)
- Voting Rights Act litigation outcomes (Section 2 claims filed, maps struck down,
  remedial maps enacted) would track enforcement effectiveness
- Seat-to-vote curve analysis: comparing simulated maps from the same census data vs.
  enacted maps tests whether enacted maps are outliers relative to the available
  geographic space
- Pre- vs. post-commission state comparison (where commissions replaced legislative
  redistricting) would test commission independence claims

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure** — District boundaries for Congress and state legislatures are redrawn
   every decade after the census; in most states, the party that controls the state
   legislature at redistricting time draws the maps, with governors holding veto power
   and courts providing post-enactment review limited after *Rucho* to Voting Rights Act
   and equal population claims.

2. **Incentive** — The controlling party can draw maps that distribute its voters
   efficiently across many winnable districts while concentrating opposing voters in a
   few overwhelmingly safe districts — translating a simple legislative majority into a
   durable structural seat advantage for the decade between redistricting cycles.

3. **Example** — Following the 2010 elections, Republicans used the REDMAP strategy to
   target state legislative races in key states, winning redistricting control in Ohio,
   Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Maps drawn in those states in 2011 produced
   congressional seat advantages that persisted through the 2020 cycle despite Democratic
   vote share increases; Wisconsin's state assembly map was subsequently found to have
   the largest efficiency gap ever measured. [Observed — source: REDMAP project
   documents; Princeton Gerrymandering Project analysis]

4. **Evidence** — Princeton Gerrymandering Project report cards; Dave's Redistricting
   App efficiency gap calculations; Brennan Center redistricting litigation tracker;
   NCSL redistricting commission comparison data; census redistricting files (PL 94-171).

5. **Levers** — Independent redistricting commissions (adopted by voter initiative in
   California, Arizona, Michigan, Colorado, and others) remove map-drawing authority
   from the legislature; multi-member proportional representation districts eliminate
   the geographic manipulation problem structurally; algorithmic "shortest-split-line"
   or fairness-constrained redistricting proposals define map criteria before partisan
   data is considered.

6. **Takeaway** — Gerrymandering translates control of state government at one point in
   time (post-census) into a structural electoral advantage that persists for a decade;
   the mechanism is geographic allocation of voters across districts, and the primary
   check is either a competing veto holder (governor, court) or a process reform that
   removes the map-drawing decision from the party benefiting from it.
