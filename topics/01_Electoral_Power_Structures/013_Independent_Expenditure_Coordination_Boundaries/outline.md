# Independent Expenditure Coordination Boundaries

**Summary:** Independent expenditures are election-related communications that expressly advocate for or against candidates and are not made in coordination with candidate committees. [Observed] Federal law permits unlimited independent expenditures by certain entities, while simultaneously prohibiting coordinated expenditures that function as in-kind contributions. [Observed] The legal boundary between independence and coordination is operationalized through conduct standards, content standards, and timing windows in Federal Election Commission regulations. [Observed] This boundary matters for power analysis because similar strategic outcomes can emerge through legally separated actors using shared consultants, public signals, and adjacent information channels. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Campaign finance law allows unlimited independent spending but treats coordinated spending as a regulated contribution, so enforcement hinges on proving specific forms of interaction. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **Candidate committees and party committees** — raise and spend funds under contribution limits and are prohibited from coordinating certain expenditures with outside groups. [Observed] Incentive: maximize message support while preserving legal separation. [Inferred] Constraint: FECA contribution limits and coordination rules. [Observed]

- **Independent expenditure-only committees (super PACs)** — make unlimited expenditures advocating electoral outcomes while maintaining legal independence from candidate campaigns. [Observed] Incentive: deploy rapid, high-volume messaging in competitive races. [Inferred] Constraint: coordination prohibitions and disclosure obligations. [Observed]

- **Consultants, media vendors, and former campaign staff** — can work across entities over time, and their movement between organizations is central to many coordination-adjacent disputes. [Observed] Incentive: retain clients and monetize specialized expertise. [Inferred] Constraint: cooling-off and conduct rules tied to material involvement and timing. [Observed]

- **Federal Election Commission** — interprets and enforces coordination rules through advisory opinions, enforcement matters, and regulations in 11 C.F.R. § 109.21. [Observed] Incentive: apply statutory framework consistently across cases. [Observed] Constraint: multi-member voting structure and evidentiary limits. [Observed]

- **Federal courts** — review constitutional and administrative challenges to coordination standards and related campaign finance restrictions. [Observed] Constraint: case-by-case adjudication and deference doctrines for agency interpretations. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- **Step 1 — Spending plan design:** Candidate and outside-group strategists separately design messaging plans around shared electoral calendars and publicly available information. [Observed]

- **Step 2 — Vendor execution:** Committees and independent spenders purchase media, polling, and digital services, sometimes from overlapping firms operating under legal firewalls. [Observed]

- **Step 3 — Communication launch:** Outside groups run ads and voter-contact programs categorized as independent expenditures and file reports with the FEC. [Observed]

- **Step 4 — Complaint and review pathway:** Opponents, watchdogs, or regulators raise potential coordination concerns; enforcement depends on documentary and testimonial evidence meeting rule thresholds. [Observed]

- **Step 5 — Adjudication or closure:** Matters are resolved through dismissal, negotiated outcomes, or litigation, with many cases ending short of final sanction. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Legal counsel and compliance professionals who determine whether planned communications pass coordination tests before deployment. [Observed]

- **Bottlenecks:** Access to internal communications, vendor work-product records, and timeline evidence needed to prove prohibited interaction. [Observed]

- **Veto points:** FEC vote thresholds, prosecutorial discretion, and judicial review stages that can stop or narrow enforcement trajectories. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- **Rule-evasion through public signaling** — campaigns and outside groups can rely on publicly released strategic cues that reduce direct contact while preserving message alignment. [Inferred]

- **Enforcement asymmetry from evidentiary burden** — proving coordination often requires evidence that is difficult to obtain absent subpoena-heavy investigations. [Observed]

- **Firewall formalism risk** — formal consultant firewalls can satisfy documentation requirements while leaving practical strategic overlap unresolved. [Inferred]

- **Disclosure timing gaps** — reporting windows can delay public visibility into spending relationships until after key campaign moments. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- FEC enforcement dockets comparing allegation types, evidentiary findings, and outcomes would test claims about enforcement asymmetry. [Observed]

- Time-linked analysis of ad buys, consultant overlap, and message synchronization would test whether coordination-adjacent patterns cluster in competitive races. [Hypothesis]

- Internal policy documents and firewall protocols from vendors would test whether compliance controls materially change cross-client information flow. [Hypothesis]

- Court rulings on coordination disputes would test which regulatory elements are treated as decisive in practice. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure** — U.S. campaign finance rules distinguish independent expenditures from coordinated expenditures, with materially different legal treatment and limits. [Observed] This creates a boundary-enforcement regime rather than a spending-cap regime for outside groups. [Observed]

2. **Incentive** — Campaigns and outside spenders seek strategic alignment while preserving formal legal separation, and compliance teams structure workflows around that objective. [Inferred]

3. **Example** — In the post-SpeechNow period, super PAC growth and recurring coordination complaints illustrated how overlapping consultant ecosystems and public signaling can generate disputes without straightforward proof of prohibited contact. [Observed]

4. **Evidence** — FEC enforcement files, advisory opinions, court decisions, and spend-report datasets provide the core record for evaluating how boundaries are interpreted and enforced. [Observed]

5. **Levers** — More granular machine-readable disclosure, standardized consultant overlap reporting, clearer safe-harbor/firewall documentation requirements, and faster post-filing transparency pipelines are concrete accountability mechanisms. [Inferred]

6. **Takeaway** — Coordination boundaries are a central control point in modern campaign finance: legal independence can be clear on paper while strategic interdependence remains an ongoing governance and enforcement challenge. [Inferred]
