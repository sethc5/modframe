# Primaries and Candidate Gatekeeping

**Summary:** Primaries narrow candidate fields before general elections, but key rules
for voter eligibility, ballot access, and delegate allocation are set by state law and
party procedures rather than a single federal framework. [Observed] Primary electorates
are typically smaller and more ideologically concentrated than general electorates,
creating strategic pressure on candidates to prioritize primary-specific incentives.
[Observed] Ballot access and filing rules add an additional gatekeeping layer that shapes
which candidates can compete effectively. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** State election law and party rules determine who can vote
and who can appear on primary ballots, concentrating nomination power in a smaller,
ideologically sorted electorate. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **State governments** — set primary election type (closed, open, semi-open,
  blanket/top-two), administer ballots, set filing deadlines and ballot access
  requirements; incentive: state legislatures often set rules that advantage their own
  party; constraint: subject to First and Fourteenth Amendment review and Voting Rights
  Act requirements. [Observed — source: state election codes; NCSL primary type survey]

- **State and national party committees** — set additional eligibility rules for
  closed primaries; national committees (DNC, RNC) promulgate delegate selection rules
  that state parties must follow for presidential primaries; incentive: shape the
  nominee pool toward party-preferred candidates; constraint: Supreme Court has affirmed
  party associational rights to set membership criteria. [Observed — source: *California
  Democratic Party v. Jones*, 530 U.S. 567 (2000); DNC Delegate Selection Rules, 2024]

- **Incumbent officeholders** — benefit from name recognition, established donor
  networks, and party support in primaries; incentive: retain office; constraint:
  incumbents can face primary challenges when perceived as ideologically out of step with
  the primary electorate. [Inferred — incumbency advantages in primaries are documented
  in political science literature but causally multifactorial]

- **Major donors and bundlers** — disproportionately influential in primaries due to the
  smaller fundraising pool; early money signals viability to other donors and media;
  incentive: select nominees aligned with their policy interests; constraint: individual
  contribution limits apply to primary fundraising as in general elections. [Inferred —
  donor influence on primary outcomes is observable in fundraising-outcome correlations
  but causally complex]

- **Party activists and primary voters** — primary electorates are smaller, older, and
  more ideologically homogeneous than general election electorates; in closed primaries
  only registered party members may vote; incentive: select nominees aligned with
  ideological preferences; constraint: constrained to candidates who have passed ballot
  access requirements and fundraising viability thresholds. [Observed — source: Pew
  Research Center, "Political Polarization in the American Public," 2014; ANES primary
  turnout data]

- **Media organizations** — coverage decisions amplify or marginalize candidates before
  voting begins; early polling and "money primary" coverage affects donor behavior;
  incentive: cover competitive and high-profile races; constraint: limited airtime and
  editorial capacity. [Inferred — media effects on primary outcomes documented in
  political communication research but difficult to isolate causally]

### Process map (bulleted)

- **Step 1 — Ballot access:** Candidate files with state election authority; pays filing
  fee or collects the required number of registered-voter petition signatures; meets
  party affiliation requirements (varies by state); challenge period allows opponents to
  contest petition validity. [Observed — source: state election codes; NCSL ballot access
  survey; Ballotpedia state filing requirements database]

- **Step 2 — The "money primary":** Before any votes are cast, candidates compete for
  donor support; fundraising totals are reported to FEC quarterly and scrutinized by
  media as a viability signal; candidates below threshold fundraising face reduced press
  coverage and donor attention. [Observed — source: FEC fundraising reports; political
  science literature on pre-primary fundraising as viability signal]

- **Step 3 — Campaign and voter contact:** Candidates target the likely primary
  electorate, which in closed primaries is restricted to registered party members; in
  open primaries, strategic crossover voting by members of the other party is possible
  though its magnitude is debated. [Observed — source: state election rules; Hypothesis
  — systematic crossover voting effects on outcomes are disputed in the literature]

- **Step 4 — Primary election:** Registered eligible voters cast ballots; winner
  determined by state rules (plurality, runoff threshold, ranked-choice where applicable);
  for presidential primaries, delegates are allocated according to DNC or RNC rules, which
  may be winner-take-all, proportional, or hybrid depending on state and party. [Observed
  — source: state election codes; DNC/RNC delegate selection rules]

- **Step 5 — Nomination:** Primary winner (or delegate-majority winner for presidential
  races) advances to the general election as the party's nominee; in top-two primary
  states (California, Washington), the two highest vote-getters advance regardless of
  party, which may produce two candidates from the same party in the general election.

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** State election officials who adjudicate ballot access petitions; party
  committees that set primary eligibility rules; large early donors whose contributions
  determine which candidates are treated as viable by press and subsequent donors.
  [Inferred — gatekeeping function is structural and well-documented; causal magnitude
  of each mechanism varies by race context]

- **Bottlenecks:** Ballot access petition requirements can exclude candidates without
  sufficient organizational infrastructure; early fundraising viability threshold
  effectively screens candidates before voters have input; in closed primaries, party
  registration requirements limit the electorate to a subset of voters. [Observed —
  source: NCSL ballot access requirements; FEC fundraising data]

- **Veto points:** State legislature control over primary type and ballot access rules;
  national party committee rules on delegate allocation; in presidential primaries, the
  DNC's superdelegate system (currently limited to second-ballot voting after 2018
  reform) preserves a formal party-establishment veto on first-ballot contested
  conventions. [Observed — source: DNC Rule 12.J, 2022 Delegate Selection Rules;
  RNC Rule 40]

### Common failure modes

- **Electorate-nominee mismatch** — [Observed] Primary electorates are more ideologically
  homogeneous than general electorates. Research shows that congressional primary voters
  are consistently more liberal (Democratic) or conservative (Republican) than their
  party's general election coalition, creating structural pressure on nominees to adopt
  positions that may be electorally costly in November. [Source: Pew Research Center
  primary voter typology studies; Andrew Hall, "Who Wants to Run?" (2019)]

- **Incumbent insulation** — [Inferred] Incumbents rarely lose primaries, even when their
  voting records diverge from constituent preferences, due to name recognition, fundraising
  advantages, and media incumbency effects. This reduces primary accountability as a
  check on incumbent behavior. Incumbents lost fewer than 3% of congressional primary
  contests from 2000–2020. [Source: Ballotpedia primary results database; Hypothesis —
  causal mechanism for insulation is multifactorial and disputed]

- **Ballot access as structural barrier** — [Observed] Filing fees and petition signature
  requirements create unequal access. Several states require thousands of signatures
  within short collection windows, disadvantaging candidates without party infrastructure
  or volunteer networks, and effectively restricting competition to well-funded or
  party-backed entrants. [Source: NCSL ballot access requirements survey; Libertarian and
  Green party legal challenges documented in state courts]

- **Low turnout amplification** — [Observed] Primary turnout is substantially lower than
  general election turnout — averaging 20–27% of eligible voters in congressional
  primaries — meaning a small, activated fraction of the electorate effectively selects
  nominees for the majority of voters in safe-seat districts. [Source: Brookings
  Institution, "Primary Election Turnout and Representation" (2018)]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Systematic comparison of primary voters vs. general election voters by ideology (ANES,
  Pew) would quantify the electorate mismatch and track it over time
- Roll-call vote analysis comparing legislators who faced competitive primaries vs. safe
  incumbents would test whether primary threat produces legislative behavior shifts
- Ballot access petition challenge outcomes by state would document which requirements
  systematically exclude candidates
- Top-two primary states (California, Washington) vs. closed primary states provide
  natural comparison for studying primary type effects on general election outcomes

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure** — Primaries narrow the candidate field before the general election, but
   who can vote and who can appear on the ballot is determined by a patchwork of state
   election codes and party rules, not a single federal standard — producing significant
   variation across states in both access and electorate composition.

2. **Incentive** — Candidates face a structural incentive to appeal to primary voters
   (smaller, more ideologically homogeneous) rather than general election voters;
   state parties and legislatures that control primary rules have incentives to set them
   in ways that favor their preferred candidates; major donors have incentives to invest
   early, before voter input begins.

3. **Example** — In the 2014 congressional election cycle, incumbent House Majority
   Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) lost his primary to David Brat, a relatively unknown
   challenger, in the most prominent recent instance of primary accountability working as
   designed. The case is also notable for how unusual it is: Cantor was one of the most
   powerful members of Congress, and incumbents at his level almost never lose primaries.
   [Observed — source: Virginia Department of Elections results, June 2014]

4. **Evidence** — ANES primary voter ideology data; Pew Research Center typology studies;
   Ballotpedia primary results database (incumbents vs. challengers); FEC pre-primary
   fundraising reports; California and Washington election results for top-two comparison.

5. **Levers** — Top-two primary systems (California, Washington) open the primary
   electorate to all registered voters regardless of party, potentially reducing the
   ideological extremity of the deciding electorate; nonpartisan redistricting commissions
   reduce the safe-seat dynamic that amplifies primary leverage; ranked-choice voting in
   primaries allows voters to express preferences across multiple candidates without
   strategic consolidation pressure.

6. **Takeaway** — Primary elections are the earliest and least visible stage of candidate
   selection; because the rules governing them are set by states and parties rather than
   a unified federal standard, they vary substantially in who they include — and that
   variation determines which voters have effective power over the nominee pool before
   the general election begins.
