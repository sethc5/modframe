# Convention Delegate Math

**Summary:** Convention delegate math is the rule-based system that converts primary and caucus results into delegate totals used to nominate presidential candidates. [Observed] Parties define allocation formulas, thresholds, bonus delegates, and convention voting rules, so candidate viability depends on rule design as much as raw vote share. [Observed] Small differences in thresholds, district-level allocation, and unbound delegate rules can create large differences in nomination trajectories over time. [Observed] The topic matters for power analysis because parties can shape incentives for candidate strategy, coalition building, and campaign resource deployment through mathematical allocation rules. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Party rules translate votes into delegates through thresholds and allocation formulas, and nomination control follows whichever candidate reaches required delegate majorities. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **National party committees (DNC/RNC)** — write and enforce delegate allocation and convention voting rules for presidential nominations. [Observed] Incentive: balance coalition inclusion with orderly nomination outcomes. [Inferred] Constraint: internal rulemaking procedures and political legitimacy concerns. [Observed]

- **State party organizations** — implement national rules in state-level delegate plans, including district allocation, filing requirements, and delegate selection conventions. [Observed] Incentive: maximize state influence and procedural compliance. [Inferred] Constraint: required conformity with national party rules. [Observed]

- **Presidential campaigns** — target states and congressional districts based on delegate efficiency, thresholds, and calendar effects rather than only headline vote totals. [Observed] Incentive: maximize delegates per marginal dollar or organizing unit. [Inferred] Constraint: ballot access and organizational capacity. [Observed]

- **Convention delegates** — cast nomination votes under party-specific rules, including bound/unbound status and multi-ballot procedures. [Observed] Incentive: represent candidate coalitions or state preferences depending on binding status. [Inferred] Constraint: party credentialing and convention rules. [Observed]

- **Rules and credentials committees** — adjudicate disputes and can materially affect delegate counts through recognition decisions and challenge resolutions. [Observed] Constraint: procedural transparency and intra-party contestation. [Inferred]

### Process map (bulleted)

- **Step 1 — Rule publication:** National parties publish delegate allocation and convention rules before the cycle begins. [Observed]

- **Step 2 — State implementation:** State parties submit compliant delegate selection plans and election calendars under national constraints. [Observed]

- **Step 3 — Primary/caucus voting:** Voters produce candidate vote shares, which are converted into delegates by threshold and allocation formulas. [Observed]

- **Step 4 — Delegate selection and binding:** Delegates are selected and bound/unbound status is set by party/state rules for convention voting. [Observed]

- **Step 5 — Convention counting:** Convention procedures determine when a candidate has reached required majorities and whether additional ballots are needed. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** National rules committees and state party administrators who define or implement formulas that convert votes into delegate outcomes. [Observed]

- **Bottlenecks:** Threshold effects and district-level allocation can produce nonlinear delegate outcomes that campaigns must model accurately to remain viable. [Observed]

- **Veto points:** Credentials rulings, delegate challenge decisions, and convention ballot rules can alter margins in close nominations. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- **Threshold distortion** — candidates with meaningful vote share below threshold can receive zero delegates in particular contests, increasing representation gaps. [Observed]

- **Calendar front-loading effects** — clustered early contests can accelerate delegate accumulation before weaker campaigns can scale nationally. [Inferred]

- **Rule complexity opacity** — public understanding often focuses on vote percentages while delegate allocation mechanics remain underexplained. [Observed]

- **Dispute escalation at convention stage** — close margins can shift conflict from voters to procedural committees and credentials disputes. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Historical simulations comparing vote shares to delegate outcomes under alternative thresholds would test distortion claims. [Hypothesis]

- State-by-state delegate plan datasets and official allocation tables would test whether campaigns that optimize by district outperform statewide-vote-focused strategies. [Hypothesis]

- Convention credentials decisions and challenge records would test the material impact of procedural rulings on final delegate totals. [Observed]

- Calendar timing analysis across cycles would test whether front-loading predicts faster nomination lock-in. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure** — Delegate math converts contest results into nomination power using thresholds, district/state allocations, and convention voting rules. [Observed] The formulas are party-defined and cycle-specific. [Observed]

2. **Incentive** — Campaigns optimize for delegate efficiency, not only vote totals, which drives district targeting and strategic calendar prioritization. [Observed] Rule design therefore shapes campaign behavior before the convention. [Inferred]

3. **Example** — In the 2016 Democratic nomination, superdelegate alignment and proportional allocation rules produced a delegate narrative that differed from some raw primary vote interpretations, contributing to rule-reform pressure before the 2020 cycle. [Observed]

4. **Evidence** — Official delegate allocation tables, state delegate selection plans, convention rules, and credentials decisions provide the primary records needed to reconstruct outcomes. [Observed]

5. **Levers** — Simplified public delegate calculators, clearer threshold disclosures, and standardized machine-readable state allocation files are concrete levers for transparency and accountability. [Inferred]

6. **Takeaway** — Nomination outcomes reflect both voter preferences and the conversion rules that map votes to delegates, making rule architecture a central locus of intra-party power. [Observed]
