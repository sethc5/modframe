# State Criminal Justice and Prosecutorial Discretion

**Summary:** Elected county and district prosecutors exercise the most consequential discretionary authority in the American criminal justice system, making charging, plea-bargaining, and sentencing-recommendation decisions that determine incarceration outcomes for millions of people with minimal external oversight. Prosecutorial discretion operates within state criminal codes that define offenses and set penalty ranges, but prosecutors' charging choices—which offenses to file, whether to seek mandatory minimums, and what plea offers to extend—effectively determine sentences more than judges or juries do. The rise of "progressive prosecutor" campaigns has politicized prosecutorial discretion, with reform DAs in cities like Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Los Angeles drawing backlash from law enforcement, state legislatures, and recall campaigns.

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Elected prosecutors exercise unreviewable charging discretion that determines criminal justice outcomes, concentrating sentencing power in an office with minimal accountability mechanisms. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- Elected district and county attorneys set office-wide charging policies, prioritize prosecution targets, and exercise individual case discretion over charging and plea negotiations. [Observed]
- State legislatures define criminal offenses and penalty ranges, but prosecutorial charging discretion determines which statutory provisions are actually enforced. [Observed]
- Public defenders and defense counsel negotiate plea agreements and challenge prosecutorial overcharging, but resource disparities limit their capacity to counterbalance prosecution power. [Observed]
- Law enforcement agencies investigate crimes and present cases to prosecutors, with police-prosecutor relationships shaping which cases are pursued and how charges are framed. [Observed]
- Victims and community organizations advocate for prosecution priorities, with victim-rights provisions in some states giving crime victims input into charging and plea decisions. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- Law enforcement presents case files to the prosecutor's office, which decides whether evidence supports filing charges and which specific offenses to charge. [Observed]
- Prosecutors select charges from the menu of applicable offenses, with charging choices determining mandatory-minimum applicability, sentencing-guideline calculations, and plea-bargaining leverage. [Observed]
- Plea negotiations resolve approximately 95% of criminal cases, with prosecutors offering charge reductions or sentencing recommendations in exchange for guilty pleas. [Observed]
- Cases that proceed to trial require prosecutorial resource allocation decisions that prioritize some prosecutions over others based on office policy and capacity. [Observed]
- Post-conviction, prosecutors may support or oppose clemency petitions, sentence modifications, and conviction-integrity reviews, extending discretionary influence beyond sentencing. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Prosecutors' unreviewable charging decisions determine who enters the criminal justice system and on what terms, with no external check on the initial charging choice. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Plea-bargaining dynamics give prosecutors asymmetric leverage because defendants face exponentially higher sentences if convicted at trial (the "trial penalty"). [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Prosecutorial refusal to enforce specific laws (marijuana possession, low-level theft) effectively nullifies legislative enactments without formal repeal. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Charging disparities by race, income, and geography produce unequal justice outcomes when prosecutors exercise discretion without consistent standards. [Observed]
- The trial penalty—the gap between plea-offer sentences and post-trial sentences—coerces guilty pleas from defendants who might be acquitted at trial. [Observed]
- Prosecutor-police interdependence creates reluctance to investigate or charge law enforcement misconduct, undermining accountability for police abuses. [Observed]
- Progressive-prosecutor reforms face backlash through state legislative preemption, governor removal authority, and recall campaigns that constrain local democratic accountability. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze charging data by defendant demographics and offense type to document disparities in prosecutorial discretion across jurisdictions. [Observed]
- Compare sentencing outcomes in jurisdictions with reformed versus traditional prosecution offices to assess the impact of policy changes. [Observed]
- Track plea-bargaining patterns to measure the trial penalty and its effects on defendants' exercise of the right to trial. [Observed]
- Survey prosecutors on the factors influencing charging decisions to identify the explicit and implicit criteria that drive discretion. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the institutional framework of prosecution including election, jurisdiction, office structure, supervisory authority, and the relationship between state criminal codes and prosecutorial charging discretion. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show how electoral incentives, conviction-rate metrics, police relationships, and media attention shape prosecutorial priorities and individual case decisions. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace the progressive-prosecutor movement in specific jurisdictions (Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles) to illustrate how reform campaigns, implementation challenges, and political backlash interact. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use charging data, plea-bargaining statistics, sentencing disparity analysis, and case-outcome comparisons to document how prosecutorial discretion shapes criminal justice outcomes. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate reforms including charging guidelines, data transparency requirements, conviction-integrity units, independent police-misconduct prosecution, and restorative-justice diversion programs. [Observed]
6. **Takeaway:** Prosecutorial discretion demonstrates how unreviewable individual authority concentrated in a single office can determine systemic outcomes for millions with minimal structural accountability. [Inferred]
