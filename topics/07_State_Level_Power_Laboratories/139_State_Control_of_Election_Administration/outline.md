# State Control of Election Administration

**Summary:** Election administration in the United States is radically decentralized, with approximately 10,000 local jurisdictions managing elections under state-level rules set by legislatures, secretaries of state, and election boards—creating enormous variation in voter access, ballot design, counting procedures, and certification processes. Since 2020, state legislatures have enacted hundreds of laws modifying election procedures, with changes to voter-ID requirements, mail-ballot access, drop-box availability, voter-roll maintenance, and election-worker protections reflecting intensified partisan contestation over the rules of democratic participation. Control over election administration has become a primary arena of political competition, as procedural choices about who can vote, how votes are cast, and how results are certified directly affect electoral outcomes.

**Mechanism in one sentence:** State legislatures and election officials set election rules that determine voter access, ballot procedures, and result certification, making election administration a site of partisan power competition. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- State legislatures enact election codes governing voter registration, identification requirements, ballot access, early voting, mail voting, and result certification. [Observed]
- Secretaries of state (elected in 35 states) administer election law, issue guidance to local officials, certify results, and maintain voter-registration databases. [Observed]
- County election boards and local clerks manage day-to-day election operations including polling-place designation, ballot design, equipment procurement, and vote counting. [Observed]
- Partisan poll watchers and election observers monitor voting and counting processes, with recent expansions of observer authority creating friction at polling places. [Observed]
- Voting-rights organizations litigate election-law changes and mobilize voter participation through registration drives, education campaigns, and election-protection hotlines. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- State legislatures establish the legal framework for elections, including registration deadlines, identification requirements, voting methods, and certification timelines. [Observed]
- Secretaries of state and election boards implement legislative requirements through administrative rules, poll-worker training, equipment standards, and voter-database management. [Observed]
- Local officials manage election-day operations: staffing polling places, processing ballots, resolving provisional-ballot disputes, and conducting initial vote tabulation. [Observed]
- County and state canvassing boards certify election results through legally specified processes, with challenge and contest procedures available for disputed outcomes. [Observed]
- Post-election audits, recounts, and litigation resolve contested results, with court orders and legislative certification completing the process. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Secretaries of state exercise broad interpretive authority over election codes, with administrative guidance effectively determining voter access in ambiguous statutory areas. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Local election offices with inadequate funding and staffing create disparities in voter access, with under-resourced jurisdictions producing longer wait times and higher error rates. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Certification requirements create leverage points where partisan officials may delay or refuse to certify results, as demonstrated in post-2020 certification disputes. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Restrictive voting laws disproportionately burden minority, low-income, and young voters who face greater barriers to obtaining identification and accessing polling places. [Observed]
- Under-resourced election offices cannot adequately staff polling places, maintain equipment, or process mail ballots, producing preventable access failures. [Observed]
- Partisan secretaries of state may exercise interpretive discretion to advantage their party's electoral prospects through selective implementation of election laws. [Observed]
- Election-worker threats and political pressure undermine the nonpartisan administration necessary for legitimate democratic processes. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare voter turnout and demographic participation rates across states with different election-administration rules to measure the access effects of procedural choices. [Observed]
- Track election-law changes by state legislative partisan composition to assess whether election rules correlate with party control. [Observed]
- Analyze polling-place wait times and provisional-ballot rates by jurisdiction demographics to document disparities in election-administration quality. [Observed]
- Survey election workers on political pressure, threats, and resource adequacy to assess the state of election-administration infrastructure. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the institutional architecture of election administration from state legislatures through secretaries of state to local election offices, identifying authority relationships and resource flows. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show how partisan control of election rules creates incentives to manipulate voter access—expanding access for likely supporters and restricting it for opponents. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace specific election-administration controversies (Georgia SB 202, mail-ballot expansion/restriction, or certification disputes) to illustrate how procedural choices shape democratic participation. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use turnout data, demographic participation analysis, wait-time measurements, and election-worker surveys to document the effects of administration choices on voter access. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate reforms including automatic voter registration, nonpartisan election administration, federal minimum standards, and election-infrastructure funding mandates. [Observed]
6. **Takeaway:** State control of election administration demonstrates how procedural authority over democratic participation can be weaponized to predetermine electoral outcomes through rules rather than persuasion. [Inferred]
