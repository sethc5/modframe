# Governors' Budget and Line-Item Veto Power

**Summary:** Governors in 44 states possess line-item veto authority that allows them to strike individual appropriations from budget bills without vetoing the entire legislation, concentrating fiscal power in the executive branch in ways that fundamentally reshape budget negotiations with state legislatures. This authority ranges from narrow item-veto power (striking specific dollar amounts) to broad "Frankenstein veto" power (combining partial vetoes to alter legislative intent), creating asymmetric bargaining dynamics where legislators must anticipate gubernatorial editing of their appropriations work. The line-item veto transforms the governor from a reactive check on legislative spending into an active editor of fiscal policy, concentrating budgetary agenda-setting in the executive. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Line-item veto authority allows governors to selectively strike appropriations from budget bills, concentrating fiscal bargaining power in the executive branch. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- Governors exercise line-item veto authority to shape final budget outcomes, using the threat of selective vetoes as leverage during legislative negotiations. [Observed]
- State legislative appropriations committees draft budgets knowing the governor can edit their work, adjusting strategies to protect priority items from veto. [Observed]
- Legislative leaders negotiate with governors' offices to identify veto-proof provisions and secure executive commitments on budget priorities. [Observed]
- State budget offices within the executive branch prepare the governor's budget proposal and advise on line-item veto strategy. [Observed]
- Interest groups lobby both legislative and executive branches, recognizing that appropriations must survive both legislative passage and gubernatorial line-item review. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- The governor submits an executive budget proposal that establishes spending priorities and frames legislative budget negotiations. [Observed]
- Legislative committees develop their own budget through hearings, markups, and floor amendments, often diverging from the governor's proposal. [Observed]
- The legislature passes a final budget bill; the governor reviews each appropriation line item and exercises selective veto authority. [Observed]
- Vetoed items are returned to the legislature, which may attempt to override with a supermajority vote—a threshold rarely achieved. [Observed]
- The final enacted budget reflects both legislative priorities that survived veto and executive preferences enforced through the line-item veto power. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Governors control the final composition of enacted budgets through selective line-item vetoes, making the executive the last mover in fiscal policy. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** The supermajority threshold for veto override makes legislative reversal of gubernatorial budget edits exceptionally difficult. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** In states with broad line-item or "reduction" veto authority, governors can alter appropriation amounts rather than just eliminating items, expanding executive fiscal discretion. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Broad line-item veto authority enables governors to rewrite legislative intent by selectively combining partial vetoes in ways the legislature never intended. [Observed]
- The veto threat creates legislative self-censorship where appropriations committees avoid including items they believe the governor will strike. [Inferred]
- Line-item vetoes may target politically vulnerable items (community projects, minority-district funding) as punishment for legislative opposition. [Observed]
- Budget brinksmanship intensifies when governors use line-item veto threats as leverage for non-budgetary policy concessions. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare budget outcomes and executive-legislative bargaining patterns in states with and without line-item veto authority to measure the power's effect. [Observed]
- Track line-item veto usage rates, override attempt rates, and success rates across governors and partisan configurations. [Observed]
- Analyze whether line-item vetoes disproportionately target legislative districts of opposition-party members to test the punitive-veto hypothesis. [Hypothesis]
- Survey legislative appropriators on how anticipated line-item vetoes affect their budgeting strategies and priorities. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map line-item veto authority across states, categorizing by scope (item elimination, reduction, amendatory, Frankenstein) and the institutional constraints on each type. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show how governors leverage veto authority to dominate budget negotiations, and how legislators adapt their strategies to minimize gubernatorial editing of their work. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific budget cycle where line-item vetoes substantially altered legislative appropriations, such as Wisconsin's "Frankenstein veto" controversies or California budget disputes. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use veto databases, budget comparison data, and override attempt records to measure how line-item authority shifts fiscal outcomes toward executive preferences. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate reforms including narrowing veto scope, reducing override thresholds, requiring veto justifications, and providing legislative budget-office independence. [Observed]
6. **Takeaway:** Line-item veto authority illustrates how procedural last-mover advantage in the budget process concentrates fiscal power in the executive branch at the expense of legislative deliberation. [Inferred]
