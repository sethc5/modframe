# News Aggregation and Algorithmic Curation

**Summary:** News aggregation platforms—including Google News, Apple News, Flipboard, and social media feed algorithms that surface news content—have become primary information intermediaries, determining which news stories reach audiences and which outlets receive traffic, advertising revenue, and audience attention. These platforms select, rank, and present news content through algorithmic curation systems that prioritize engagement, recency, and personalization over editorial quality, source diversity, or civic importance. This matters because aggregation platforms now control a significant share of news distribution without producing original reporting, creating a dependency relationship in which news organizations must optimize for platform algorithms to reach their audiences.

**Mechanism in one sentence:** News aggregation platforms intermediate between news producers and audiences through algorithmic curation that prioritizes engagement over editorial quality, controlling distribution without producing journalism. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- Google News, Apple News, and other aggregation platforms select and rank news content using algorithms that reflect platform-defined relevance and engagement criteria. [Observed]
- Social media platforms (Facebook, X, Reddit) function as secondary news aggregators through feed algorithms that surface shared news content alongside non-news material. [Observed]
- News publishers depend on aggregation platforms for audience traffic and must optimize headlines, formatting, and content strategies for algorithmic ranking. [Observed]
- Advertising technology companies mediate revenue allocation between platforms and publishers, typically capturing a disproportionate share of digital advertising revenue. [Observed]
- Users interact with aggregated news through personalized feeds that reflect their behavioral history, creating algorithmically filtered information environments. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- News organizations publish content, which aggregation platforms index, classify, and rank according to proprietary algorithmic criteria. [Observed]
- Algorithms surface stories based on engagement predictions, user interest profiles, and recency signals rather than editorial importance or source authority assessments. [Observed]
- Users encounter news through algorithmically curated feeds that present stories from multiple outlets without distinguishing between high- and low-quality sources except through minimal credibility signals. [Observed]
- Traffic and revenue flow disproportionately to platforms rather than publishers, creating a structural subsidy of aggregation by original reporting that weakens newsroom economics. [Observed]
- Publishers adapt content strategies to platform algorithms, producing headline-optimized, engagement-driven content that may differ from what editorial judgment would prioritize. [Inferred]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Google and Apple News algorithm designers control curation criteria that determine which stories reach hundreds of millions of users, concentrating editorial-equivalent power in technology companies. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Search engine optimization and platform algorithm knowledge become essential newsroom competencies, creating a technical bottleneck that advantages well-resourced outlets. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Platform decisions to deindex, downrank, or promote specific outlets function as distribution veto points without editorial accountability. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Engagement-optimized curation systematically surfaces sensational and emotionally arousing content over substantive reporting, distorting the news information environment. [Observed]
- Revenue capture by aggregation platforms undermines the economic model for original reporting, reducing journalism investment while increasing dependence on platform distribution. [Observed]
- Personalized news feeds create filter bubbles where users receive algorithmically reinforced perspectives rather than diverse information exposure. [Observed]
- Low-quality and misinformation outlets can receive significant algorithmic distribution when their content generates engagement, undermining source-quality differentiation. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare news story rankings on aggregation platforms with editorial importance assessments by journalism experts to measure curation quality divergence. [Hypothesis]
- Track the share of news traffic and advertising revenue captured by aggregation platforms versus original news publishers over time. [Observed]
- Measure information diversity in algorithmically curated versus editorially curated news feeds to assess filter-bubble effects. [Observed]
- Analyze publishers' content-strategy adaptations to platform algorithms to measure the editorial influence of algorithmic intermediation. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the news aggregation ecosystem from publisher content through platform indexing and algorithmic curation through user consumption, identifying the intermediation layers. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show why aggregation platforms succeed (user convenience, advertising efficiency) and why publishers depend on them despite unfavorable economic dynamics (audience reach, competitive necessity). [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace how a major news story's distribution was shaped by aggregation platform algorithms, comparing algorithmic curation with editorial judgment about the story's importance. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use traffic data, revenue analyses, content-strategy studies, and audience-exposure research to measure aggregation's effects on journalism and information quality. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate reforms including publisher-platform revenue sharing mandates (Australia/Canada models), algorithmic curation transparency, platform antitrust enforcement, and journalism tax credits. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** News aggregation illustrates how platform intermediation can capture the economic value of journalism while reshaping its content and distribution through algorithmic criteria that prioritize engagement over democratic information needs. [Inferred]
