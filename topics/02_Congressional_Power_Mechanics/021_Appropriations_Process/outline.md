# Appropriations Process

**Summary:** The appropriations process allocates annual discretionary federal spending
through a sequence of budget resolutions, subcommittee drafting, chamber negotiations,
and enactment deadlines. [Observed] It matters because this process determines which
agencies receive operational funding, under what constraints, and with which policy riders
attached to spending authority. [Observed] Appropriations is a central power channel
because timing pressure and omnibus packaging can shift influence from committees toward
leadership and executive negotiators. [Observed] Repeated reliance on continuing
resolutions and late-cycle packages changes who can effectively review, amend, and contest
spending decisions, weakening the deliberative quality that the committee structure was
designed to produce. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Appropriations power flows through calendar control,
subcommittee jurisdiction, and must-pass funding deadlines that convert procedural timing
into bargaining leverage over policy and oversight conditions. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- **House and Senate Appropriations Committees** — exercise jurisdiction over all
  discretionary spending through twelve paired subcommittees, each covering a defined
  set of federal agencies and programs; draft bill text, spending directives, and report
  language that constrains (though does not legally bind) agency implementation;
  incentive: maintain jurisdictional influence over federal spending and deliver
  constituent-relevant allocations; constraint: total spending is capped by 302(a)
  allocations from the budget resolution, and internal 302(b) suballocations further
  limit each subcommittee's discretion. [Observed — source: Congressional Budget Act
  of 1974, § 302; House Rule X, clause 1]

- **Appropriations subcommittee chairs ("cardinals")** — twelve subcommittee chairs in
  each chamber wield disproportionate influence over their jurisdictional slice of
  discretionary spending; they select witnesses for hearings, draft initial bill text,
  and negotiate with counterparts across chambers and with the executive; incentive:
  maximize influence within jurisdiction while balancing party leadership priorities;
  constraint: full committee chair and leadership can override subcommittee decisions
  during full committee markup or floor packaging. [Observed]

- **Chamber leadership** — the Speaker, majority leader, and their Senate counterparts
  determine sequencing, package strategy (stand-alone bills vs. minibus vs. omnibus),
  and amendment conditions; under deadline pressure, leadership increasingly bypasses
  subcommittee deliberation to negotiate directly with executive branch principals;
  incentive: avoid government shutdowns and manage caucus vote exposure; constraint:
  members on appropriations committees resist leadership encroachment on their
  jurisdictional prerogatives. [Observed]

- **Office of Management and Budget (OMB)** — compiles the president's annual budget
  request, reviews agency spending proposals, issues apportionments controlling the
  rate of obligation, and can impound or defer spending under limited statutory
  authority; incentive: align federal spending with presidential priorities; constraint:
  the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires congressional notification and approval
  for deferrals and rescissions. [Observed — source: Impoundment Control Act, 2 U.S.C.
  § 681 et seq.]

- **Agency budget offices and chief financial officers** — translate appropriations into
  operational spending plans, manage obligation and outlay timing, and implement report
  language directives; incentive: maximize operational flexibility within appropriated
  amounts; constraint: Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits obligations exceeding
  appropriations. [Observed — source: 31 U.S.C. § 1341]

- **Government Accountability Office (GAO)** — audits agency spending, evaluates program
  performance, maintains the biennial High Risk List, and reports violations of the
  Impoundment Control Act; incentive: provide nonpartisan accountability analysis;
  constraint: recommendations are non-binding and typically arrive after appropriations
  decisions are finalized. [Observed — source: 31 U.S.C. § 712]

### Process map (bulleted)

- **Step 1 — President's budget request:** The President submits a detailed budget
  request to Congress by the first Monday in February; committees use it as an analytical
  input and political reference point rather than a binding spending plan. [Observed
  — source: 31 U.S.C. § 1105]

- **Step 2 — Budget resolution and allocations:** Congress adopts (or, increasingly,
  bypasses) a concurrent budget resolution setting aggregate discretionary spending
  limits; the Appropriations Committees receive 302(a) allocations and divide them among
  subcommittees through 302(b) suballocations, establishing the spending ceiling for
  each subcommittee's bill. [Observed — source: Congressional Budget Act, § 302]

- **Step 3 — Subcommittee markups:** Subcommittees hold hearings, draft bill text with
  account-level funding decisions, and include policy riders (legislative provisions
  attached to spending bills); report language accompanying the bill provides non-binding
  directives that agencies typically follow to maintain committee relationships.
  [Observed]

- **Step 4 — Full committee and floor action:** Full Appropriations Committees mark up
  subcommittee products, potentially modifying allocations, riders, and directives;
  bills proceed to the floor under rules governing amendment opportunities and debate
  time; in the Senate, amendments are subject to cloture and germaneness constraints.
  [Observed]

- **Step 5 — Bicameral reconciliation:** House and Senate reconcile differing bill
  versions through conference committees or amendment exchange ("ping-pong"); calendar
  compression in recent decades has increasingly pushed reconciliation into leadership-
  level negotiations with minimal committee involvement. [Observed]

- **Step 6 — Enactment or stopgap:** If all twelve bills are enacted individually by
  October 1, the fiscal year begins under regular-order appropriations; if not, Congress
  passes continuing resolutions (CRs) that extend prior-year funding levels, often with
  modifications, or consolidates remaining bills into omnibus or minibus packages; since
  FY 1997, Congress has completed all twelve regular appropriations bills on time only
  four times. [Observed — source: CRS Report R46560]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Appropriations subcommittee chairs control initial drafting and
  hearing access within their jurisdiction; full committee chairs and leadership determine
  which bills advance and in what form (stand-alone vs. packaged); OMB controls the
  budget request baseline and post-enactment apportionment. [Observed]

- **Bottlenecks:** Limited floor time and deadline compression force bundling decisions
  that reduce member-level amendment opportunities; when multiple bills are consolidated
  into an omnibus, individual subcommittee products lose their separate floor
  consideration and amendment process. [Observed — source: Brookings Vital Statistics
  on Congress, appropriations completion data]

- **Veto points:** Senate cloture thresholds can block stand-alone bills; presidential
  veto authority and shutdown brinkmanship create leverage over final package content;
  the Byrd Rule can strip policy riders from budget reconciliation vehicles if they
  lack a direct budgetary effect. [Observed — source: U.S. Const. art. I, § 7;
  2 U.S.C. § 644]

### Common failure modes

- **Deadline governance** — [Inferred] Deadline pressure encourages short-horizon
  bargaining that prioritizes passage over detailed program evaluation; negotiators
  focus on resolving political disputes by the funding deadline rather than aligning
  spending with performance findings or agency needs assessments.

- **Omnibus opacity** — [Observed] Large omnibus packages dilute line-item scrutiny
  and obscure tradeoffs across unrelated policy domains; members voting on a consolidated
  bill that spans all of discretionary government cannot meaningfully evaluate each
  component. The FY2024 omnibus was 1,012 pages and covered all twelve appropriations
  bills. [Source: Congress.gov, H.R. 4366]

- **Oversight-budget disconnect** — [Observed] GAO and IG findings typically lag
  appropriations timelines by one or more cycles, meaning performance problems
  identified in audits are not reflected in the funding decisions that created them;
  the GAO High Risk List identifies dozens of programs at risk, but appropriations
  changes in response are inconsistent. [Source: GAO High Risk Series]

- **CR normalization** — [Observed] Continuing resolutions and government shutdown
  threats have become normalized negotiating tools rather than emergency measures,
  reducing institutional pressure to complete regular-order appropriations; agencies
  operating under CRs cannot start new programs, adjust staffing, or respond to changed
  conditions. [Source: CRS Report R46560]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare regular-order completion rates versus omnibus/CR usage by Congress from
  FY1976 to present, including the number of individual bills enacted before the fiscal
  year deadline. [Observed — source: CRS appropriations status tables]
- Measure amendment opportunities (number offered, accepted, and rejected) across
  stand-alone appropriations bills versus consolidated packages to quantify deliberation
  compression. [Observed]
- Track GAO High Risk List items and agency performance audit findings against
  subsequent account-level funding changes in appropriations bills to assess whether
  the feedback loop between oversight and funding is functional. [Inferred]
- Review government shutdown and near-shutdown episodes to evaluate whether deadline
  pressure systematically shifts bargaining leverage from subcommittee chairs to
  leadership and executive actors. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure** — Define the annual appropriations architecture: twelve subcommittees
   per chamber, 302(a)/302(b) allocations, the relationship between budget resolutions
   and appropriations bills, and the difference between regular order, CRs, and omnibus
   packaging.

2. **Incentive** — Explain why deadline pressure, electoral calendars, and must-pass
   funding requirements drive package consolidation behavior; show how leadership benefits
   from packaging power and why subcommittee chairs resist but often lose control under
   time pressure.

3. **Example** — Compare a regular-order appropriations cycle (rare — such as FY2006)
   to a recent omnibus cycle with multiple CR bridges, leadership-level negotiations,
   and a late-session consolidated package, showing how the process difference affects
   amendment opportunity, oversight integration, and rider visibility.

4. **Evidence** — Present committee reports, floor calendars, amendment counts per
   vehicle type, CR frequency data, and GAO High Risk List follow-through rates to test
   centralization and oversight-feedback claims empirically.

5. **Levers** — Evaluate reforms including automatic CR provisions (to remove shutdown
   leverage), biennial budgeting, earlier markup deadlines, transparent rider tracking
   databases, and account-level performance linkage requirements.

6. **Takeaway** — The appropriations process governs operational state capacity, and
   its increasing reliance on deadline governance and consolidated packaging determines
   who actually controls budget outcomes; restoring regular order is not a procedural
   nicety but a structural prerequisite for meaningful congressional spending oversight.
