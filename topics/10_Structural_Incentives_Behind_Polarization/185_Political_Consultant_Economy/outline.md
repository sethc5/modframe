# Political Consultant Economy

**Summary:** A multi-billion-dollar industry of political consultants, media buyers, polling firms, opposition research firms, and digital fundraising vendors derives revenue from campaign spending, creating financial incentives within the consultant class to perpetuate competitive conflict, inflate perceived race competitiveness, and resist structural reforms that would reduce campaign activity. [Observed] Media consultant fee structures — historically a percentage commission on television advertising buys (typically 10–15%) — meant that high-spending competitive campaigns were dramatically more lucrative than uncontested or low-spending races, structurally incentivizing consultants to maximize ad buys and sustain adversarial campaign dynamics. [Observed] Digital fundraising vendors operating on performance fees have analogous incentives: sustained donor activation (which conflict messaging drives) generates more vendor revenue than efficient, low-intensity campaigns. [Inferred] The political consultant economy is a second-order structural incentive for polarization: it does not directly cause political conflict, but it creates a class of professional actors whose economic interests align with the perpetuation of high-intensity, high-spending, high-conflict campaigns. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** The political consulting industry's fee structures create financial incentives to maximize campaign spending and conflict intensity, producing a professional class whose economic interest aligns with perpetuating rather than resolving political competition. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Media consultants and ad buyers** — design television, digital, and radio advertising for campaigns; historically compensated on commission (percentage of ad buy), incentivizing maximum ad spending. [Observed]
- **Digital fundraising vendors** — manage email list strategy, fundraising copy, and A/B testing for campaigns; often compensated on percentage of funds raised, incentivizing high-volume, high-conflict fundraising. [Observed]
- **Polling firms** — provide candidate and campaign message testing; contracted throughout the campaign cycle; more polling cycles mean more revenue. [Observed]
- **Opposition research firms** — compile research on opposing candidates; their core product requires the existence of competitive adversarial contests. [Observed]
- **Voter data vendors (i360, NGP VAN, TargetSmart)** — sell voter data, modeling, and targeting services; more campaigns and higher campaign budgets mean more vendor revenue. [Observed]
- **Party campaign committees (DCCC, DSCC, NRCC, NRSC)** — direct campaigns toward approved vendor lists, creating consultant oligopolies within each party; approved vendor relationships are valuable business assets. [Observed]
- **FEC** — requires disclosure of campaign disbursements to vendors, providing visibility into consultant spending; does not regulate fee structures or create fiduciary obligations. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A candidate wins a primary and enters the general election; party campaign committees refer the campaign to approved vendor lists. [Observed]
- The campaign hires consultants who assess the race competitiveness and recommend a budget; consultants who earn higher fees on larger budgets have a financial incentive to characterize the race as more competitive than independent analysis might suggest. [Inferred]
- Media consultants negotiate ad buy volumes with television stations and digital platforms; commission-based consultants maximize the buy size within the campaign's available resources. [Observed]
- Polling firms are engaged at regular campaign intervals; each poll generates revenue; consultants may recommend more frequent polling than the decision-making needs of the campaign strictly require. [Inferred]
- FEC disbursement disclosures document payments to consultants; the same consultant firms appear across multiple campaigns in each party's orbit, building entrenched vendor relationships. [Observed]
- After the election, successful consultants use win records and fundraising performance to recruit new clients; the metric of success is winning and raising money, not efficient use of campaign resources. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Party campaign committee approved vendor lists function as oligopolies; campaign managers who rely on committee support face pressure to use approved vendors regardless of price or quality. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Television ad buying requires professional media buyers who have station relationships; this technical bottleneck creates consultant dependency even for campaigns that would prefer direct buying. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Consultants who are deeply embedded in the party infrastructure can resist candidate demands to change strategy; the information asymmetry between consultant (who knows the industry) and candidate (who does not) favors consultant preferences. [Inferred]

### Common failure modes

- The commission-based fee structure creates a direct conflict of interest between the consultant (who profits from spending) and the campaign (which needs efficient resource allocation); this conflict is not disclosed or regulated. [Observed]
- Approved vendor lists limit competition within party networks, reducing price pressure and allowing established vendors to maintain above-market margins on campaign services. [Inferred]
- The consultant economy rewards high-spending competitive races; candidates who seek to run “lean” campaigns with minimal consultant involvement face institutional resistance from party infrastructure. [Observed]
- Because consultant compensation is tied to campaign spending, consultants have structural incentives to recommend advertising strategies over earned media, grassroots organizing, or other cost-effective tactics. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze FEC disbursement data to calculate the share of campaign spending captured by consultants, stratified by race competitiveness and party. [Observed — FEC data]
- Compare consultant per-vote costs across commission-based and flat-fee contract structures to measure the efficiency impact of fee design. [Hypothesis — requires consultant contract data]
- Track the same consultant firms across multiple campaign cycles to measure their revenue growth relative to total campaign spending growth. [Observed — FEC data]
- Survey campaign managers about consultant recommendations vs. campaign strategic interests to measure the frequency of conflicts of interest. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the political consulting industry — categories of vendors, fee structures (commission vs. flat), party approved vendor lists, and the scale of the industry relative to total campaign spending. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why commission-based fee structures create systematic bias toward higher spending and conflict intensity — the consultant and campaign have structurally misaligned financial interests. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific high-spending Senate race through its vendor payments — document what share of total spending went to consultants, on what fee structures, and whether spending correlated with efficiency metrics. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present FEC disbursement data on the consultant share of campaign budgets across competitive vs. non-competitive races; show vendor concentration within party networks. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate whether flat-fee disclosure requirements, fiduciary-duty standards for political consultants, or public financing programs that restrict consultant commission structures could alter the incentive landscape. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The political consulting industry's economic incentives are structurally aligned with perpetuating high-cost, high-conflict campaigns — not with efficient democratic competition; this creates a professional class whose interests run counter to structural reform of the campaign finance and electoral system. [Inferred]
