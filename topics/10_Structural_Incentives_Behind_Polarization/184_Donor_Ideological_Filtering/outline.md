# Donor Ideological Filtering

**Summary:** The major fundraising networks available to federal candidates are organized around ideological factions, meaning that a candidate who deviates from the ideological priorities of these networks faces higher fundraising costs and smaller donor bases than a candidate who conforms to them. [Observed] On the right, the Koch network (Americans for Prosperity, Stand Together), the Club for Growth, and associated donor councils coordinate fundraising for candidates who align with low-tax, deregulatory priorities; on the left, EMILY's List, ActBlue-linked progressive bundler networks, and labor-affiliated PACs coordinate fundraising for candidates who align with their priorities. [Observed] Candidates who seek to build a non-ideologically-filtered fundraising base must substitute large numbers of unaffiliated small donors (expensive to acquire) or major individual donors with idiosyncratic interests — an economically inferior strategy compared to tapping an established ideologically organized network. [Inferred] The structural effect is that ideological conformity to a faction's priorities is a component of fundraising efficiency, making it financially rational for candidates to adopt and maintain positions that satisfy their primary donor network even when those positions may reduce their legislative room to maneuver. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Ideologically organized donor networks make conformity to factional priorities a component of fundraising efficiency, creating financial incentives for candidates to adopt and maintain positions that satisfy their primary donor ecosystem. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Candidates for federal office** — need fundraising networks at scale; accessing organized ideological networks requires demonstrating ideological alignment through issue positions, endorsements, and voting records. [Observed]
- **Major individual donors (“mega-donors”)** — write maximum checks to multiple candidates but often coordinate through donor councils that share intelligence on candidate reliability; candidates who defect from donor network priorities may find the network closed. [Observed]
- **Bundlers** — individuals who aggregate contributions from personal networks; major bundler networks are ideologically sorted, limiting the candidates who can access them. [Observed]
- **Ideological PACs and super PACs (Club for Growth, EMILY's List, Chamber of Commerce)** — serve as credentialing institutions that signal to diffuse donor networks that a candidate is ideologically aligned; their endorsement unlocks downstream contributions. [Observed]
- **Party campaign committees (DCCC, DSCC, NRCC, NRSC)** — provide fundraising platform access and donor list introductions to candidates they support; candidates out of favor with the committee face reduced access. [Observed]
- **FEC** — regulates contribution limits and disclosure requirements for donors to candidates and PACs; unlimited contributions to super PACs are permissible under *Citizens United* (2010). [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A candidate running for federal office assesses the available fundraising networks and calibrates issue positions to access the most productive networks for their district and ideology. [Inferred]
- Ideological PACs and donor councils conduct due diligence on the candidate: reviewing issue positions, questionnaire responses, prior voting record, and association with credentialing organizations. [Observed]
- The PAC or donor council provides early money (a critical credibility signal) and introduces the candidate to affiliated donor networks, unlocking bundler access and large donor meetings. [Observed]
- The candidate receives contributions that are correlated with demonstrated ideological alignment; deviation from the network's priorities risks the loss of future fundraising access. [Inferred]
- Once in office, the member's voting record is monitored by donor network organizations; votes that deviate from network priorities generate signals (scorecard downgrades, fundraising freezes, primary threat) that apply financial discipline. [Observed]
- The aggregate effect is a class of officeholders whose ideological positions are filtered by their fundraising networks rather than vice versa: position follows the money as much as money follows the position. [Inferred]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Major donor network organizations (Club for Growth, EMILY's List, Koch network) function as credentialing institutions whose endorsement unlocks access to affiliated donor ecosystems. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** The bundler system concentrates fundraising efficiency in a small number of high-network individuals who work through established ideological networks; candidates outside those networks must raise money retail at high cost. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Major donors who operate across multiple candidate portfolios can signal displeasure through coordinated withdrawal of fundraising support, functioning as a factional veto on candidate positioning. [Inferred]

### Common failure modes

- The 2010 *Citizens United* ruling (and subsequent *SpeechNow.org v. FEC*) eliminated dollar limits on contributions to super PACs, increasing the leverage of ideologically organized major donors relative to unaffiliated small donors. [Observed]
- The ideology-fundraising alignment is self-reinforcing: candidates who access ideological networks win more frequently, generating data that confirms the strategy, which recruits more candidates into the same networks. [Inferred]
- Disclosure requirements for major donors to 501(c)(4) organizations are limited, creating opacity in the actual ideological network structure that drives candidate funding. [Observed]
- Candidates who seek to run outside ideological networks face a structural cost disadvantage that reduces their probability of winning primaries, limiting the self-correction mechanism. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Correlate FEC contribution data from ideological PAC donors with member legislative voting records to measure the alignment between donor network priorities and voting behavior. [Observed — Open Secrets and FEC data]
- Analyze the issue positions of candidates endorsed by major ideological PACs before and after endorsement to test whether endorsement follows position or precedes position change. [Hypothesis]
- Track the fundraising performance of candidates who publicly deviated from their donor network's priorities relative to matched candidates who maintained alignment. [Observed — FEC data]
- Audit dark money 501(c)(4) organizations' issue expenditure disclosures to estimate the share of candidate funding that flows through ideologically filtered networks. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map how ideological donor networks operate — donor councils, bundler systems, credentialing PACs, and the process by which network access is granted or withheld based on candidate positioning. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why candidates rationally adopt ideologically filtered positions — accessing an established donor network is dramatically cheaper per dollar raised than building an unaffiliated small-donor base from scratch. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific candidate's fundraising trajectory through an ideological network endorsement — Club for Growth or EMILY's List endorsement as the unlock for downstream donor access. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present FEC data correlating ideological PAC donor activity with member voting record alignment; analyze the *Citizens United* impact on donor network leverage. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate small-dollar matching programs (Democracy Vouchers, FECA matching funds reform) as mechanisms to reduce the relative weight of organized ideological donor networks. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Ideologically organized donor networks function as a credentialing and discipline system that shapes candidate positions from the recruitment stage through the legislative career — a structural filter that makes ideological conformity a component of electoral viability. [Inferred]
