# Fundraising Incentives for Conflict

**Summary:** Members of Congress raise more money during periods of partisan conflict, legislative crisis, and ideological confrontation than during periods of compromise or bipartisan cooperation. [Observed] Small-dollar online fundraising platforms (ActBlue, WinRed) algorithmically amplify conflict-based messaging by surfacing the appeals that generate the most clicks and conversions — which are disproportionately messages tied to outrage, threat, and polarization. [Observed] This creates a structural feedback loop in which members who adopt confrontational legislative postures generate campaign revenue that reinforces that posture, while members who compromise may trigger small-dollar donor backlash and primary threats. [Inferred] The financial architecture of modern congressional campaigns therefore embeds a structural incentive against legislated resolution of recurring political conflicts such as immigration, debt ceiling, and government funding — because those conflicts are the most lucrative fundraising contexts. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Congressional fundraising platforms reward conflict-based messaging with higher donor response rates, creating a financial incentive structure that discourages legislative resolution of recurring partisan crises. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Members of Congress** — primary fundraisers; their campaign messaging is calibrated to maximize small-dollar donor response, which skews toward conflict framing. [Observed] Incentive: campaign revenue; constraint: FEC contribution limits and reporting requirements.
- **ActBlue / WinRed** — online bundling platforms that process the majority of small-dollar congressional fundraising; each platform's algorithmic display of recurring contribution options creates compounding feedback toward high-engagement (high-conflict) messaging. [Observed]
- **Campaign consultants and email vendors** — hired by campaigns to write fundraising copy and manage list strategy; fees are often tied to fundraising performance, creating incentives to test and amplify conflict-based appeals. [Observed]
- **Small-dollar donor base** — primarily partisan activists with above-average ideological intensity; research shows they respond at higher rates to threat and outrage framing than to policy accomplishment framing. [Observed]
- **Congressional campaign committees (DCCC, NRSC, NRCC, DSCC)** — run shared fundraising infrastructure and training for members; their campaign schools teach conflict-based digital fundraising as a core skill. [Observed]
- **FEC** — regulates contribution limits and disclosure; does not regulate the content or framing of fundraising appeals. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A member or challenger identifies a political conflict (government shutdown, debt ceiling, Supreme Court decision, controversial floor vote) as a fundraising trigger event. [Observed]
- Campaign staff and consultants draft fundraising emails and digital ads framing the conflict as an urgent threat that only the member can counter, with an explicit donation ask. [Observed]
- Emails are sent to the campaign list; A/B tests measure open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates; the most conflict-laden versions are scaled. [Observed]
- ActBlue/WinRed process the donations; their recurring-contribution prompts lock in the most conflict-responsive donors as reliable monthly revenue streams. [Observed]
- Fundraising performance data informs future legislative positioning: members whose opposition to a bill generates more money than support would have had a concrete financial reason to oppose similar bills in the future. [Inferred]
- FEC disclosures allow consultants and members to benchmark conflict-based fundraising performance across the congressional class, spreading successful tactics. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Campaign consultants and email list vendors control which messaging strategies members adopt; lists owned by high-performance consultants become valuable assets shared across campaigns. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** ActBlue and WinRed are effective duopolies processing small-dollar Democratic and Republican congressional fundraising respectively; their platform design choices shape fundraising norms across the congressional class. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Members who resist conflict-based messaging face lower small-dollar revenue, requiring them to compensate with larger-check fundraising from donors who may impose different ideological demands. [Inferred]

### Common failure modes

- The fundraising-conflict feedback loop operates outside any formal regulatory framework; FEC disclosure requirements reveal its outputs (fundraising amounts) but not its mechanisms (messaging strategy, A/B testing). [Observed]
- Members who want to negotiate compromise may rationally conceal their intentions from their donor base until a deal is signed — an asymmetric information problem that slows legislative progress. [Inferred]
- Consultant fee structures tied to fundraising performance create conflicts of interest: the consultant profits most from a sustained, high-conflict campaign, not from efficient legislative resolution. [Observed]
- The recurring-contribution model means members have predictable monthly revenue tied to donor activation on conflict issues; resolving those issues could destabilize the revenue base. [Inferred]
- House freshmen are often trained by party campaign schools in conflict-based digital fundraising before they learn legislative procedure, establishing the fundraising frame as the primary lens for their role. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare FEC-reported fundraising volumes for members in weeks following high-conflict legislative events (government shutdowns, debt ceiling standoffs) vs. weeks with no major conflict. [Observed]
- Analyze open rates and click-through rates for conflict-framed vs. policy-accomplishment-framed fundraising emails across a congressional cohort. [Hypothesis — requires vendor data access]
- Track whether members who voted for bipartisan compromise deals experienced measurable drops in small-dollar fundraising relative to members who voted against. [Observed — FEC data]
- Audit consultant contracts disclosed in FEC filings to measure what share of campaign spending goes to email/digital vendors on performance-based fee structures. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map how congressional small-dollar fundraising works — ActBlue/WinRed platforms, email list economics, consultant fee structures, and the A/B testing infrastructure that determines which messages members send to donors. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why conflict-based messaging outperforms accomplishment-based messaging in small-dollar fundraising — donor psychology, platform algorithm design, and the selection of who joins activist donor lists. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific legislative standoff through its fundraising signature — document the spike in member fundraising during the crisis and whether the money flowed to members who prolonged or resolved the conflict. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present FEC data showing fundraising patterns correlated with conflict events; document the growth of ActBlue/WinRed processing volumes relative to the rise of recurring political crises. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate whether disclosure of A/B testing results, flat-fee consultant contracts, or campaign finance matching systems could alter the incentive structure. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The fundraising infrastructure of congressional campaigns financially rewards the maintenance of conflict and punishes its resolution — a structural misalignment between the campaign finance economy and the legislative function of Congress. [Inferred]
