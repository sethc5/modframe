# Cooling-Off Period Structures

**Summary:** Federal cooling-off periods prohibit former senior government officials from lobbying their former agencies or colleagues for specified durations after leaving office, with restrictions varying by branch, seniority level, and type of activity under statutory and executive-order frameworks. These rules matter because their effectiveness depends on definitional scope, enforcement capacity, and whether the prohibited activities capture the actual channels through which former officials exercise influence. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Cooling-off periods create time-limited bans on specific lobbying contacts by former officials, but their impact depends on whether influence pathways extend beyond the narrowly defined prohibited activities. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- Former senior executive branch officials face one-year or two-year bans on lobbying their former agencies, with the most senior officials subject to broader communication restrictions under 18 U.S.C. § 207. [Observed]
- Former members of Congress are subject to a one-year cooling-off period (two years for senators) before they may lobby current members or staff of the chamber they served in. [Observed]
- Former senior congressional staff face a one-year ban on lobbying the member, committee, or leadership office where they worked, though contacts with other offices are unrestricted. [Observed]
- The Office of Government Ethics and agency ethics officials advise departing officials on post-employment restrictions and issue opinion letters, but lack independent enforcement authority for criminal provisions. [Observed]
- The Department of Justice Criminal Division has jurisdiction over 18 U.S.C. § 207 violations but rarely prosecutes, creating an enforcement environment where compliance is largely self-directed. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A departing official receives ethics counseling on applicable cooling-off restrictions based on their position, seniority, and specific duties during their final year of service. [Observed]
- The official leaves government and may immediately engage in non-lobbying influence activities including strategic consulting, coalition management, and public advocacy without restriction. [Observed]
- During the cooling-off period, the former official is prohibited from making lobbying contacts with specific former colleagues or agencies, though behind-the-scenes strategy work for lobbying campaigns is generally permitted. [Observed]
- Upon expiration of the cooling-off period, all contact restrictions lapse and the former official may register as a lobbyist and engage directly with any government official. [Observed]
- Enforcement depends on complaints, investigative journalism, or self-reporting; the Department of Justice may pursue criminal charges for knowing violations, but referrals are infrequent and prosecutions rare. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Agency ethics officials determine which restrictions apply to departing officials and can shape compliance expectations through advisory opinions, but cannot prevent post-government career choices. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** The narrow definition of "lobbying contact" creates a bottleneck where only direct representational communications are restricted, while strategic advising, preparation, and supervision pass through unrestricted. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Congressional reluctance to extend cooling-off periods or broaden their scope effectively vetoes reforms that would close the strategy-advising loophole. [Inferred]

### Common failure modes

- Former officials can provide strategic intelligence and relationship mapping to lobbying teams without making direct contacts, delivering substantial value while technically complying with cooling-off restrictions. [Observed]
- The narrow scope of prohibited activities means a former official's most valuable asset—knowledge of internal decision-making processes, personnel dynamics, and policy vulnerabilities—can be monetized immediately. [Inferred]
- Inconsistent cooling-off durations across branches and seniority levels create perverse incentives where officials may prefer certain exit paths that minimize restriction scope. [Observed]
- Low prosecution rates signal that cooling-off violations carry minimal career risk, especially when violations are difficult to distinguish from permitted strategic advisory work. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Track career transitions of senior officials before and after cooling-off period expiration to measure whether restrictions delay or merely defer lobbying registration. [Observed]
- Compare compensation data for former officials in strategic advisory roles during cooling-off periods versus post-expiration lobbying roles to test whether advisory work captures equivalent economic value. [Inferred]
- Analyze DOJ prosecution and declination data for 18 U.S.C. § 207 referrals to measure enforcement intensity and deterrent capacity. [Observed]
- Survey former officials on how cooling-off restrictions affected their post-government career planning and whether compliance was primarily driven by legal risk or reputational concern. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the cooling-off framework across branches and seniority levels, explaining which activities are prohibited, which are permitted, and how duration and scope vary. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show why former officials and their new employers structure engagement to capture the value of government relationships while technically complying with contact restrictions. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a former senior official's post-government career path through strategic advisory work during the cooling-off period and subsequent lobbying registration to illustrate how the system operates in practice. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use lobbying registration timing data, enforcement records, and compensation patterns to test whether cooling-off periods create meaningful delay or cosmetic compliance. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Assess reforms including extended cooling-off durations, broader activity definitions covering strategic advising, lifetime bans for specific issue areas, and enhanced disclosure requirements during the restricted period. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Cooling-off periods address the most visible form of revolving-door influence but leave the most valuable components—knowledge, relationships, and strategic judgment—unrestricted, limiting their effectiveness as integrity safeguards. [Inferred]
