# Congressional Insider Trading Rules

**Purpose:** This module analyzes the STOCK Act's disclosure and enforcement architecture for congressional securities trading, mapping how delayed reporting, trivial penalties, self-policing, and high prosecution thresholds create a system that documents information advantages without constraining them.

Status: draft

## Key actors
- Members of Congress (disclosure obligations, trading activity)
- Congressional staff (restricted post-2013 disclosure)
- House Committee on Ethics / Senate Select Committee on Ethics (self-policing)
- DOJ Public Integrity Section (criminal prosecution referrals)
- Securities and Exchange Commission (civil enforcement)
- GAO (compliance studies)
- Transparency aggregators (Capitol Trades, Quiver Quantitative, Unusual Whales)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- STOCK Act (Pub. L. 112–105, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78u–6)
- Securities Exchange Act of 1934, § 10(b) (general insider trading prohibition)
- 2013 STOCK Act amendment (removing online staff disclosure)

## Case study
- **Pre-COVID trading (2020)**: Multiple senators disclosed stock trades made after classified COVID-19 briefings but before public market awareness. Ethics investigations were opened; DOJ declined prosecution in all cases, illustrating the structural gap between documented suspicious trading and enforceable insider trading.

## Data sources
- House and Senate periodic transaction reports (PTRs)
- House and Senate annual financial disclosure reports
- Academic studies on congressional trading returns (Ziobrowski et al.)
- GAO STOCK Act compliance reports
- Capitol Trades / Quiver Quantitative / Unusual Whales aggregated data
