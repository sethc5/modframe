# Internal Review Boards in Federal Agencies

**Purpose:** This module maps the landscape of internal review mechanisms across federal agencies — grievance boards, ALJ panels, use-of-force review boards, and boards of contract appeals — analyzing how these bodies operate within the institutional hierarchy they are supposed to check.

## Key actors
- Agency administrative law judges (formal adjudication under APA)
- Agency grievance and appeals boards (employee disputes, EEO)
- Law enforcement use-of-force review boards (FBI, ATF, CBP, ICE, USSS)
- Boards of Contract Appeals (ASBCA, CBCA)
- Merit Systems Protection Board (external appellate review)
- Federal courts (judicial review of agency adjudications)
- Agency heads (board appointment, procedural rule-setting)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- 5 U.S.C. §§ 556–557 (Administrative Procedure Act, formal adjudication)
- 41 U.S.C. § 7105 (boards of contract appeals)
- 5 U.S.C. §§ 7701–7703 (MSPB appellate jurisdiction)
- Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237 (2018) (ALJ Appointments Clause requirements)

## Case study
- **CBP use-of-force review board practices**: Customs and Border Protection's internal use-of-force review has been criticized for clearing officers at high rates with limited transparency, prompting multiple GAO investigations and DOJ Civil Rights Division reviews.

## Data sources
- MSPB annual reports and case outcome data
- GAO reports on federal workplace dispute resolution
- DOJ Civil Rights Division pattern-or-practice investigation reports
- Agency-specific ALJ adjudication data
- Inspector General reports on internal review effectiveness
