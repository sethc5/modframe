# Internal Review Boards in Federal Agencies

**Summary:** Federal agencies use internal review boards, administrative appeals bodies, and adjudicatory panels to resolve disputes over personnel actions, program decisions, compliance determinations, and use-of-force incidents — but these mechanisms operate within the same institutional hierarchy they are supposed to check, limiting their independence and transparency. [Observed] Examples include agency administrative law judge panels, employee grievance boards, law enforcement use-of-force review boards, and agency-level boards of contract appeals. [Observed] The structural challenge is that internal review boards are typically staffed by agency personnel, funded by the agency budget, and subject to institutional pressure from the leadership whose decisions are under review — creating a review architecture that may produce thorough process documentation while reliably reaching conclusions that protect institutional interests. [Inferred] External review (MSPB, federal courts) is available for some categories of decisions but involves significant procedural barriers and timeline delays that limit its corrective function. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Internal review boards adjudicate disputes within the institutional hierarchy that created them, producing review processes that are structurally oriented toward legitimizing agency decisions rather than independently scrutinizing them. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Agency administrative law judges (ALJs)** — conduct formal adjudications within agencies under the Administrative Procedure Act; enjoy some statutory independence (appointment protections, removal only for cause) but operate within the agency's institutional context. [Observed — source: 5 U.S.C. §§ 556–557; Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237 (2018)] Incentive: adjudicate fairly. Constraint: housed within the agency, subject to caseload management and institutional culture pressure. [Inferred]
- **Agency grievance and appeals boards** — hear internal employee grievances, adverse action appeals, and EEO complaints through agency-specific procedures. [Observed] Constraint: board members are typically career agency employees whose advancement depends on the same leadership structure under review. [Inferred]
- **Law enforcement use-of-force review boards** — evaluate officer-involved shootings, physical force incidents, and complaint investigations within federal law enforcement agencies (FBI, ATF, CBP, ICE, Secret Service). [Observed] Constraint: board composition, deliberation processes, and outcomes are typically not public, limiting external accountability. [Observed]
- **Boards of Contract Appeals** — adjudicate contract disputes between agencies and contractors (e.g., Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals); provide quasi-judicial review with published decisions. [Observed — source: 41 U.S.C. § 7105]
- **Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)** — external appellate body for federal employee adverse actions; provides independent review of agency personnel decisions. [Observed] Constraint: MSPB backlogs and quorum vacancies limit its function as a timely corrective mechanism. [Observed]
- **Federal courts** — review agency adjudications under deferential standards (substantial evidence, arbitrary and capricious); provide the only truly independent review but at high cost and delay. [Observed]
- **Agency heads** — appoint review board members, set board procedures, and determine whether to implement board recommendations (in advisory-board models). [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A dispute arises within the agency — adverse personnel action, EEO complaint, use-of-force incident, contract claim, or program compliance determination. [Observed]
- The matter is assigned to the appropriate internal review mechanism: grievance board, ALJ panel, use-of-force review board, or board of contract appeals. [Observed]
- The board convenes under its own procedural rules (which may or may not provide for adversarial presentation, evidence discovery, or representation). [Observed]
- The board issues findings and recommendations (advisory boards) or binding decisions (ALJ adjudications, boards of contract appeals). [Observed]
- For advisory boards, the agency head and leadership determine whether to accept, modify, or reject the board's recommendations; rejection is typically not publicly explained. [Inferred]
- Parties dissatisfied with internal board decisions may appeal to external bodies: MSPB for personnel actions, federal courts for ALJ adjudications, or the Government Accountability Office for bid protests. [Observed]
- External appeals involve substantial procedural requirements, filing deadlines, and deferential review standards that limit the scope of independent scrutiny. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Agency heads appoint board members, set procedural rules, and (for advisory boards) control whether recommendations are implemented. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** MSPB backlogs create multi-year waits for external review, leaving internal board decisions effectively final for the duration. [Observed] Federal court review operates under deferential standards that presume agency expertise, limiting the practical scope of judicial correction. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Agency heads can reject advisory board recommendations without formal consequence or public explanation. [Inferred]

### Common failure modes

- Use-of-force review boards in federal law enforcement consistently clear officers at rates that raise questions about structural bias, but the non-public nature of proceedings prevents external verification. [Inferred]
- Grievance board members who depend on agency leadership for career advancement face implicit pressure to reach institutionally favorable conclusions. [Inferred]
- ALJ independence, while statutorily protected, erodes when agencies control case assignment, caseload volume, and the institutional resources available to administrative judges. [Observed]
- Internal review board outcomes are often not published, aggregated, or reported to external oversight bodies, preventing pattern analysis across incidents. [Observed]
- The split between advisory boards (no binding authority) and adjudicatory panels (binding but narrow jurisdiction) means many significant agency decisions receive only non-binding internal review. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Compare internal review board outcomes with external appellate outcomes (MSPB, federal courts) on the same types of cases to test for institutional bias. [Observed]
- Analyze use-of-force review board clearance rates across federal law enforcement agencies and compare to external investigation outcomes (DOJ pattern-or-practice). [Inferred]
- Track grievance board member promotion rates relative to their decision patterns to test whether career consequences correlate with institutional-loyalty in adjudication. [Hypothesis]
- Measure the gap between internal board decision and external appeal filing to resolution to quantify the effective finality of internal decisions. [Observed]
- Compare complaint volumes with internal board hearing rates to measure whether internal mechanisms actually process the disputes they receive. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the landscape of internal review mechanisms across the federal government — grievance boards, ALJ panels, use-of-force boards, and boards of contract appeals. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why internal review bodies housed within the agency they review face structural pressure to reach institutionally favorable conclusions. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific internal review case (law enforcement use-of-force review, employee grievance, or contract dispute) through the full internal-to-external review pathway. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present clearance rates, appeal reversal rates, board composition data, and outcome publication practices. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate independent board member appointment, mandatory outcome publication, external review body strengthening, and structural independence requirements for internal review mechanisms. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Internal review boards create the appearance of accountability within agencies while structurally orienting toward institutional self-protection — the review mechanism is part of the institution it reviews. [Inferred]
