# Inspector General Independence Challenges

**Purpose:** This module analyzes the structural constraints on Inspector General independence — removal authority, budget dependency, information access limitations, and political pressure — that limit the effectiveness of the IG Act's independence mandate.

## Key actors
- Inspectors General (presidentially appointed and designated federal entity)
- Agency heads (budget control, information access, removal recommendations)
- The President (removal authority for presidentially appointed IGs)
- Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE)
- Congressional oversight committees (funding, hearing authority)
- Office of Management and Budget (budget formulation review)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.)
- IG Independence and Empowerment Act of 2022 (Pub. L. 117–263, §§ 5271–5274)
- IG Act § 3(b) (presidential removal with 30-day congressional notice)
- IG Act § 6(a) (right of access to agency records and information)

## Case study
- **2020 Inspector General firings**: Multiple presidentially appointed IGs removed or replaced in rapid succession, including IGs at the Intelligence Community, State Department, and DOD, demonstrating the structural vulnerability of the removal mechanism and its chilling effect on IG investigations.

## Data sources
- CIGIE oversight data and peer review reports
- GAO reports on IG independence and effectiveness
- IG semiannual reports to Congress
- POGO IG independence tracker
- Congressional Research Service reports on IG reform
