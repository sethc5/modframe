# OGE Procedural Gaps

**Summary:** The Office of Government Ethics sets ethics standards, reviews financial disclosures, and provides guidance to executive branch employees, but it lacks independent enforcement authority — relying instead on agency heads and the Department of Justice to act on its referrals and findings. [Observed] OGE can issue regulations, require financial disclosures, and review agency ethics programs, but it cannot compel compliance, impose penalties, or prosecute violations directly, making it a standard-setter without enforcement teeth. [Observed] This structural design creates a system where the government's primary ethics authority depends on the cooperation of the officials and agencies it is supposed to hold accountable, producing predictable gaps in enforcement rigor when political incentives favor non-action. [Inferred] The 2023 Ethics in Government Act reforms and OGE's expanded regulatory authority have incrementally strengthened the office's tools, but fundamental enforcement dependence on agency heads and DOJ remains the core structural limitation. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** OGE sets executive branch ethics standards and reviews disclosures but depends on agency heads and DOJ for enforcement, creating a compliance architecture where the standard-setter has no independent power to compel adherence. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Office of Government Ethics (OGE)** — issues government-wide ethics regulations (5 C.F.R. Parts 2634–2641), reviews public financial disclosure reports of presidential appointees, and evaluates agency ethics programs through periodic reviews. [Observed — source: 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 401–408] Incentive: maintain government-wide ethics standards. Constraint: no subpoena authority, no independent enforcement power, no ability to impose penalties. [Observed]
- **OGE Director** — appointed by the President with Senate confirmation to a 5-year term; leads OGE's standard-setting and program review functions. [Observed] Constraint: 5-year term provides some independence but is short enough to create vulnerability to political pressure; removal provisions provide limited protection. [Inferred]
- **Designated Agency Ethics Officials (DAEOs)** — implement ethics programs within each agency; report to agency heads (not OGE) on matters of discipline and enforcement. [Observed] Incentive: comply with OGE standards while serving the agency head's priorities. Constraint: dual loyalty between OGE guidance and agency leadership direction. [Inferred]
- **Agency heads** — receive OGE referrals for ethics violations and decide whether to take disciplinary action; control DAEO appointments and resources. [Observed] Incentive: manage agency operations and reputation. Constraint: no statutory obligation to follow OGE recommendations on enforcement. [Observed]
- **Department of Justice (Public Integrity Section)** — receives criminal referrals from OGE for potential violations of criminal conflict-of-interest statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 202–209). [Observed] Constraint: DOJ exercises prosecutorial discretion and declines the majority of ethics referrals. [Observed]
- **Senate committees** — receive financial disclosure reports and OGE opinions during the confirmation process; use disclosure reviews as a condition of advancing nominations. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- OGE issues government-wide ethics regulations covering financial disclosure, conflicts of interest, gifts, post-employment restrictions, and recusal obligations. [Observed — source: 5 C.F.R. Parts 2634–2641]
- Presidential nominees submit financial disclosure reports (OGE Form 278e) to OGE for review before Senate confirmation; OGE issues a letter certifying compliance or identifying issues. [Observed]
- Covered executive branch employees file annual public or confidential financial disclosures with their agency DAEO, who reviews for conflicts and counsels on compliance. [Observed]
- OGE conducts periodic program reviews of agency ethics offices, evaluating compliance with standards and recommending improvements. [Observed]
- When OGE identifies a potential violation, it refers the matter to the agency head for administrative action or to DOJ for criminal investigation. [Observed]
- Agency heads determine whether to impose discipline, require divestiture, or take corrective action; OGE cannot compel or override agency decisions. [Observed]
- OGE publishes ethics opinions and guidance that interpret regulations, but agencies can implement these interpretations inconsistently without consequence. [Inferred]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Agency heads control enforcement decisions on OGE referrals; DOJ controls criminal prosecution decisions on Public Integrity Section referrals. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** OGE's program review capacity is limited by staff size (~70 FTEs overseeing ~4 million executive branch employees), creating review cycle gaps of several years per agency. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Agency heads can decline OGE's enforcement recommendations with no formal override mechanism available to OGE; DOJ can decline criminal referrals with prosecutorial discretion. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- OGE referrals for enforcement are declined or delayed by agency heads who face no consequence for inaction, creating a referral-to-nowhere dynamic. [Inferred]
- Ethics waivers granted by agency heads (under 18 U.S.C. § 208(b)) receive limited OGE review and allow conflicts of interest to be formally authorized rather than resolved. [Observed]
- The confirmation-process disclosure review is OGE's highest-leverage function, but post-confirmation ongoing compliance monitoring lacks comparable institutional attention. [Inferred]
- OGE's small staff and broad mandate create resource constraints that limit the frequency and depth of agency program reviews. [Observed]
- Inconsistent DAEO quality across agencies produces uneven ethics program implementation despite uniform OGE standards. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Track OGE referral outcomes by agency: what percentage of referrals result in disciplinary action versus no action? [Observed]
- Compare ethics violation rates in agencies with recent OGE program reviews versus agencies with stale reviews to test whether oversight frequency affects compliance. [Hypothesis]
- Analyze DOJ prosecution rates on OGE criminal referrals to quantify the Public Integrity Section gatekeeping effect. [Observed]
- Measure time between OGE program review findings and agency corrective action implementation. [Inferred]
- Compare waiver issuance rates across administrations to test whether waivers function as loopholes or legitimate conflict resolution tools. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map OGE's institutional design — standard-setting authority, disclosure review, program evaluation, and referral powers without enforcement. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why enforcement dependence on agency heads and DOJ creates a structural gap where the ethics authority has the least power where it matters most. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace an ethics violation referral from OGE identification through agency non-action or DOJ declination, showing where each structural weakness operates. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present referral outcome data, program review cycle gaps, DAEO resource levels, and waiver issuance trends. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate independent OGE enforcement authority, DAEO independence requirements, mandatory action deadlines on referrals, and expanded OGE staffing. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** OGE can identify ethics failures across the executive branch but cannot fix them — the gap between standard-setting and enforcement is where accountability goes to die. [Inferred]
