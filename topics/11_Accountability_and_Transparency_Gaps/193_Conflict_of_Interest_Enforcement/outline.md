# Conflict of Interest Enforcement

**Summary:** Federal conflict-of-interest enforcement operates through a split architecture where criminal violations (18 U.S.C. §§ 202–209) are prosecuted by DOJ's Public Integrity Section, and administrative violations are handled by individual agency heads, OGE, and agency ethics officials — with no single entity possessing both detection authority and enforcement power across the full scope of potential conflicts. [Observed] Criminal prosecutions of conflict-of-interest violations are rare: DOJ's Public Integrity Section prosecutes a small number of cases annually, reflecting both the difficulty of proving criminal intent and the institutional reluctance to pursue cases that might expose the structural prevalence of conflicts across the executive branch. [Observed] Administrative enforcement depends on agencies policing their own officials, creating a self-regulation dynamic where the enforcer and the subject share institutional interests. [Inferred] The structural result is an enforcement regime that functions effectively against blatant violations by low-level officials but systematically under-enforces against senior appointees whose conflicts are formally authorized through waivers, recusal agreements, or narrow interpretation of the conflict statutes. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Conflict-of-interest enforcement splits criminal prosecution (DOJ) from administrative discipline (agency heads), creating parallel pathways where DOJ rarely prosecutes and agencies rarely discipline their own senior officials. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **DOJ Public Integrity Section** — investigates and prosecutes criminal conflict-of-interest violations under 18 U.S.C. §§ 203–209; coordinates with U.S. Attorney offices nationwide. [Observed] Incentive: maintain federal ethics enforcement credibility. Constraint: high evidentiary burden for criminal intent; institutional reluctance to prosecute politically sensitive cases involving senior officials. [Observed]
- **Office of Government Ethics (OGE)** — issues ethics guidance, reviews financial disclosures, and refers potential violations to agencies and DOJ; cannot directly impose administrative discipline. [Observed — source: 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 401–408]
- **Agency heads** — receive OGE and IG referrals for administrative conflict-of-interest violations; determine whether to impose discipline, require corrective action, or take no action. [Observed] Constraint: no statutory obligation to act on referrals. [Observed]
- **Inspectors General** — investigate potential conflicts of interest within their agencies; refer findings to agency heads for administrative action and to DOJ for criminal investigation when warranted. [Observed]
- **Designated Agency Ethics Officials (DAEOs)** — screen financial disclosures, identify potential conflicts, and counsel employees on compliance; serve as the first line of conflict detection. [Observed] Constraint: housed within the agency, reporting to the agency head. [Observed]
- **Federal courts** — adjudicate criminal conflict-of-interest cases and appeals; interpret the scope of § 208 and related statutes. [Observed]
- **Congressional committees** — conduct oversight hearings on conflict-of-interest enforcement; can request case data and enforcement statistics from DOJ and OGE. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A potential conflict of interest is identified through financial disclosure review, IG investigation, whistleblower complaint, or media reporting. [Observed]
- The DAEO or IG evaluates whether the conduct constitutes a potential violation of 18 U.S.C. § 208 (personal financial interest), § 203 (compensation for representational services), or related provisions. [Observed]
- For potential criminal violations, the matter is referred to DOJ's Public Integrity Section, which decides whether to investigate and prosecute. [Observed]
- DOJ evaluates the referral against prosecution guidelines, including evidentiary sufficiency, criminal intent evidence, and DOJ policy on conflict cases. [Observed]
- If DOJ declines prosecution, the matter may return to the agency for administrative action — but the agency is not required to act and may treat the DOJ declination as exoneration. [Inferred]
- For administrative violations, the agency head determines appropriate discipline: reprimand, suspension, demotion, removal, or no action. [Observed]
- OGE tracks enforcement outcomes to the extent agencies report them, but comprehensive government-wide enforcement data is not systematically collected or published. [Inferred]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** DOJ Public Integrity Section decides which criminal referrals to prosecute; agency heads decide which administrative referrals produce discipline. Both exercise broad discretion with limited external review. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** Criminal intent requirements for § 208 prosecutions create a high evidentiary bar that filters out most referrals; the scienter requirement means that officials who structure conflicts through waivers or narrow recusal agreements avoid criminal liability by design. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** DOJ declination decisions are not reviewable; agency head decisions on administrative discipline are not subject to OGE override. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- DOJ prosecutes conflict-of-interest violations primarily against lower-level employees, while structurally complex conflicts involving senior appointees with waivers and ethics agreements rarely result in criminal charges. [Observed]
- Agency-level administrative enforcement is inconsistent and often lenient for senior officials whose departure would create operational or political disruption. [Inferred]
- The gap between criminal and administrative enforcement means many violations fall into a zone where they are too complex for criminal prosecution but too politically sensitive for aggressive administrative action. [Inferred]
- Financial disclosure as a detection mechanism is retrospective — conflicts are identified from filings submitted after participation in the conflicting matter has already occurred. [Observed]
- Recusal agreements as a conflict resolution tool are difficult to monitor: an official may participate in matters from which they have agreed to recuse, and detection depends on internal monitoring by staff with limited independence. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze DOJ Public Integrity Section prosecution data by defendant seniority level to test the claim that enforcement disproportionately targets lower-level officials. [Observed]
- Track referral-to-prosecution rates from OGE and IGs to DOJ to quantify the prosecution funnel. [Observed]
- Compare administrative discipline rates for conflict-of-interest violations across agencies to test enforcement consistency. [Inferred]
- Measure recusal agreement compliance through FOIA requests for participation records in recused matters. [Hypothesis]
- Analyze waiver-holder participation patterns versus non-waiver-holder patterns in same-subject matters to test whether waivers correlate with pro-industry outcomes. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the split enforcement architecture — DOJ criminal prosecution, agency administrative discipline, and OGE advisory referral. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why DOJ's criminal intent requirement and agency self-policing dynamics create a system that structurally under-enforces against senior officials. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a conflict-of-interest case through the full enforcement pipeline, from disclosure detection through referral, prosecution decision, and administrative outcome. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present Public Integrity Section prosecution data, referral-to-action rates, enforcement statistics by official seniority, and recusal agreement compliance data. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate independent conflict-of-interest enforcement authority, mandatory administrative action on referrals, lower intent thresholds for administrative violations, and automated conflict detection systems. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Conflict-of-interest enforcement is designed to punish violations but structurally incapable of preventing them — the enforcement architecture activates only after the conflict has already influenced the decision. [Inferred]
