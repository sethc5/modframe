**Purpose:** This module maps the split enforcement architecture for federal conflict-of-interest violations, analyzing how criminal prosecution (DOJ), administrative discipline (agency heads), and advisory referral (OGE) interact to create structurally under-enforced ethics standards.

Status: draft

Tags: accountability, transparency, oversight, ethics, conflict-of-interest, enforcement, DOJ, OGE, public-integrity

## Key actors
- DOJ Public Integrity Section (criminal prosecution)
- Office of Government Ethics (advisory referral, guidance)
- Agency heads (administrative discipline authority)
- Inspectors General (investigation and referral)
- Designated Agency Ethics Officials (conflict detection, financial disclosure screening)
- Federal courts (criminal adjudication and appellate review)
- Congressional oversight committees

## Primary statutes and authorities
- 18 U.S.C. §§ 202–209 (criminal conflict-of-interest statutes)
- 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 401–408 (Ethics in Government Act, OGE authority)
- 5 C.F.R. § 2635 (Standards of Ethical Conduct for executive branch employees)

## Case study
- **United States v. Safavian (2008)**: Criminal prosecution of former GSA Chief of Staff for conflict-of-interest violations related to dealings with lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Case illustrates the high evidentiary bar for criminal COI prosecution and the role of DOJ's Public Integrity Section.

## Data sources
- DOJ Public Integrity Section annual reports
- OGE enforcement referral data and annual reports
- Inspector General semiannual reports to Congress
