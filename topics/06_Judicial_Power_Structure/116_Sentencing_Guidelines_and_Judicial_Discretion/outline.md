# Sentencing Guidelines and Judicial Discretion

**Summary:** The federal sentencing system operates through mandatory minimums enacted by Congress, advisory guidelines from the US Sentencing Commission, and prosecutorial charging decisions that collectively determine punishment outcomes. Since Booker (2005) rendered the Federal Sentencing Guidelines advisory, judges exercise substantial discretion, but prosecutorial control over charge selection and plea bargaining constrains this discretion by determining the statutory range within which judges operate. The result is a system where sentencing power is distributed across prosecutors, judges, and the Commission in opaque ways. [Observed]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Federal sentencing distributes power across Congress, the Sentencing Commission, prosecutors, and judges, with charging discretion often constraining judicial sentencing authority. [Observed]

### Actors and roles

- The U.S. Sentencing Commission promulgates and amends the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, calculating offense levels and criminal-history categories that produce recommended ranges. [Observed]
- Federal district judges impose sentences considering the advisory guidelines, statutory ranges, and the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). [Observed]
- Federal prosecutors exercise charging discretion that determines mandatory-minimum applicability and guideline calculations, effectively pre-determining sentencing ranges through charge selection. [Observed]
- Congress sets mandatory-minimum sentences through statutory provisions that constrain judicial discretion regardless of individual circumstances. [Observed]
- Federal public defenders and defense counsel advocate for downward departures and variances, challenging guideline calculations and presenting mitigating factors. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- Prosecutors select charges that determine which mandatory minimums and guideline provisions apply, often leveraging charge severity as plea-bargaining leverage. [Observed]
- Probation officers prepare presentence investigation reports (PSRs) that calculate guideline ranges based on offense characteristics and criminal history. [Observed]
- Defense counsel challenges guideline calculations, argues for departures and variances, and presents mitigating evidence relevant to the 3553(a) factors. [Observed]
- Judges impose sentences considering the advisory guidelines, statutory requirements, and individualized factors, explaining the basis for any departure from the guideline range. [Observed]
- Appellate courts review sentences for procedural reasonableness (correct guideline calculation) and substantive reasonableness (whether the sentence is appropriate for the case). [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Federal prosecutors serve as gatekeepers through charging decisions that determine mandatory-minimum applicability and establish the sentencing floor before any judicial involvement. [Observed]
- **Bottlenecks:** The Sentencing Commission's guideline amendments create bottlenecks as changes to offense levels or criminal-history calculations affect thousands of pending and future cases simultaneously. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Mandatory-minimum statutes function as veto points against judicial discretion, requiring specific sentences regardless of judges' assessment of individual circumstances. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Prosecutorial charging discretion creates sentencing disparities based on office policies, individual prosecutors' preferences, and plea-bargaining leverage rather than offense severity. [Observed]
- Mandatory minimums produce disproportionate sentences for low-level offenders while failing to distinguish meaningfully among defendants with different culpability levels. [Observed]
- Racial and geographic sentencing disparities persist despite guidelines designed to promote uniformity, reflecting discretionary decisions at multiple stages of the process. [Observed]
- The advisory-guidelines system produces wider sentencing variation than the mandatory system it replaced, with judicial ideology correlating with departure patterns. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze sentencing data by district, judge, and defendant characteristics to measure the extent of sentencing disparities within the advisory-guidelines system. [Observed]
- Track charging patterns across U.S. Attorney offices to document the impact of prosecutorial discretion on mandatory-minimum application rates. [Observed]
- Compare sentences for similar offenses across judicial appointees of different presidents to measure the ideological component of sentencing discretion. [Observed]
- Assess the impact of specific guideline amendments on sentencing outcomes to measure the Sentencing Commission's influence on judicial practice. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the federal sentencing framework from congressional mandatory minimums through the Sentencing Commission's guidelines through prosecutorial charging through judicial discretion, identifying the power distribution among institutions. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Show how prosecutors use charging leverage to control plea outcomes, how judges exercise post-Booker discretion, and how Congress uses mandatory minimums for political signaling. [Observed]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific sentencing case from charge selection through guideline calculation through judicial departure, illustrating the interplay between prosecutorial and judicial discretion. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Use Sentencing Commission data, inter-district comparisons, and racial-disparity analyses to document how discretion distribution creates uneven outcomes. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate reforms including mandatory-minimum repeal, enhanced guideline adherence, prosecutorial-charging transparency, and evidence-based sentencing alternatives. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The federal sentencing system demonstrates how distributing discretion across multiple institutions without transparent coordination produces outcomes driven by the most powerful actor's choices—typically the prosecutor. [Inferred]
