# Revolving Door Long Term Influence Chains

**Summary:** The revolving door between government service and the private sector operates not only as individual career transitions but as multi-generational influence chains where the same individuals cycle through government, lobbying, corporate boards, think tanks, and back to government across decades, accumulating institutional knowledge, relationships, and access that compound over time. [Observed] These long-term influence chains differ from simple revolving door transitions in their duration, scope, and structural effect: a senior official who moves from a regulatory agency to the regulated industry, then to a think tank, then back to government in a more senior position, then to a law firm, carries with them an accumulated portfolio of relationships and institutional knowledge that makes each rotation more valuable than the last. [Inferred] The structural incentive is that each career stage increases the individual's value at the next stage: government service builds expertise and relationships, private sector work monetizes them and adds industry knowledge, think tank positions provide intellectual credibility, and return to government provides additional access and authority. [Inferred] The result is a professional class of "career influence practitioners" whose primary commodity is the cross-sector knowledge and access they accumulate over decades of movement between public and private roles. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Long-term revolving door chains create compound influence where each career rotation between government, industry, and policy institutions increases the individual's access value and institutional knowledge, building multi-decade influence portfolios. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Career revolvers** — individuals who cycle through government, lobbying, corporate, and think tank positions over 20–40 year careers, accumulating cross-sector influence at each stage. [Observed] Incentive: maximize career value by leveraging each position for the next rotation. [Inferred]
- **Government agencies (hiring)** — recruit former industry and think tank professionals for expertise and institutional knowledge; gain the benefits of their private sector networks. [Observed] Constraint: ethics agreements, cooling-off periods, and recusal requirements that restrict but do not prevent the influence dynamic. [Observed]
- **Lobbying firms** — hire former government officials for their relationship portfolios; the value of a former official increases with each additional government rotation. [Observed]
- **Think tanks** — provide intellectual credibility and institutional affiliation between government and private sector positions; serve as "parking lots" during periods out of government. [Observed]
- **Regulated industries** — hire former regulators for their knowledge of regulatory processes and personnel; former regulators bring both substantive and relationship capital. [Observed]
- **Congress** — observes the revolving door but has limited ability to constrain it without addressing the underlying compensation differentials that drive it. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- An individual enters government service (often at a junior level) and develops policy expertise, procedural knowledge, and professional relationships. [Observed]
- After government service, the individual moves to a private sector role (lobbying, corporate, law firm) where their government knowledge and relationships have immediate market value. [Observed]
- In the private sector, the individual develops industry knowledge, client relationships, and an understanding of how the regulated industry operates and what it values. [Observed]
- During periods between government and private sector employment, the individual may join a think tank, gaining intellectual credibility and maintaining policy visibility. [Observed]
- The individual returns to government in a more senior position, carrying accumulated knowledge from both sectors; each rotation increases the individual's value and influence at the next stage. [Inferred]
- Cooling-off periods and ethics agreements restrict specific contacts but do not prevent the individual from leveraging the accumulated knowledge and relationships in less direct ways. [Observed]
- Over a 20–40 year career, the individual may complete 3–5 rotations, building an influence portfolio that spans multiple administrations, legislative cycles, and industry developments. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Senior revolvers accumulate gatekeeping power at each career stage — they know who to call, what arguments to make, and how to navigate both government and industry decision-making processes. [Inferred]
- **Bottlenecks:** The most valuable revolving door positions concentrate in high-regulation industries (defense, finance, healthcare, energy) where the regulatory burden creates the most demand for government expertise. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Ethics agreements and cooling-off periods are designed as structural barriers but apply only to narrow categories of direct contact, not to the strategic advisory and relationship-leveraging that constitutes most long-term influence. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Cooling-off periods are too short (1–2 years) and too narrow (direct lobbying contacts only) to disrupt multi-decade influence chains. [Observed]
- The accumulation of cross-sector influence creates a class of individuals whose primary value is access rather than expertise, distorting the policy process toward relationships over substance. [Inferred]
- Government agencies become dependent on revolving door hires for industry knowledge, creating institutional incentives to perpetuate the revolving door rather than building internal expertise. [Inferred]
- The revolving door creates implicit quid pro quo dynamics: current government officials may be influenced by the prospect of future private sector employment that depends on maintaining good relationships with regulated industries. [Inferred]
- Ethics agreements focus on individual-level conflicts but do not address the systemic effect of an entire professional class that operates across public and private sectors. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Map multi-decade career trajectories of the top 100 revolving door practitioners to test whether influence compounds across rotations. [Inferred]
- Compare policy outcomes in areas with high revolving door concentration versus areas with low revolving door activity. [Hypothesis]
- Track lobbying revenue generation by former government officials as a function of their number of rotations and seniority levels. [Inferred]
- Analyze whether regulatory enforcement intensity decreases under agency heads who previously worked in the regulated industry. [Observed]
- Survey current government officials on the influence of future employment prospects on their current decision-making. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the long-term revolving door cycle — government entry, private sector rotation, think tank parking, government re-entry, and the compounding of influence across each stage. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why each rotation increases the individual's market value and why the system structurally rewards career revolvers over career public servants or career private sector professionals. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific career revolver's 20+ year trajectory through government, lobbying, industry, think tank, and back, showing how influence accumulates at each stage. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present revolving door data by industry, seniority level, rotation count, and post-rotation lobbying revenue. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate extended cooling-off periods, lifetime lobbying bans for senior officials, revolving door tracking and transparency requirements, compensation parity between government and private sector, and institutional knowledge preservation systems. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The revolving door is not a door but a conveyor belt: it doesn't just move individuals between sectors, it creates a professional class whose compound influence grows with each rotation, making them more valuable to industry and more embedded in governance than any individual position could provide. [Inferred]
