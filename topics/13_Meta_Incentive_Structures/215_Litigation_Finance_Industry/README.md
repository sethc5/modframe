## Key actors
- Litigation finance funds (Burford Capital, Longford, Bentham IMF)
- Plaintiffs' attorneys (funded case pursuit)
- Federal and state courts (no uniform disclosure rules)
- Defendants (unaware of funder involvement)
- Regulatory agencies (face funded litigation challenges)
- Congress (disclosure legislation proposals)

## Case study
- **Patent assertion entity litigation**: Third-party litigation funders have financed patent assertion campaigns that impose settlement pressure on technology companies, illustrating how financial return incentives can drive litigation patterns that shape industry behavior and regulatory outcomes.

## Data sources
- Burford Capital and industry annual reports
- U.S. Chamber ILR TPLF reports
- GAO Third-Party Litigation Financing report
- Advisory Committee on Civil Rules disclosure proposals
