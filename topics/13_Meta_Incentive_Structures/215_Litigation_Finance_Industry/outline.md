# Litigation Finance Industry

**Summary:** Third-party litigation finance (TPLF) — where investment funds provide capital to plaintiffs or law firms in exchange for a share of litigation proceeds — has grown into a multi-billion-dollar global industry that intersects with public policy in ways that are largely unregulated and non-transparent: funders can finance constitutional challenges, regulatory litigation, mass tort actions, and patent enforcement campaigns that shape legal precedent and regulatory outcomes, all without any disclosure requirement that would reveal the financial interests behind the litigation. [Observed] The structural design of litigation finance creates a market where access to the judicial system is allocated by financial return potential rather than legal merit, since funders select cases based on expected recovery rather than the strength of the underlying claim. [Inferred] Neither federal nor most state courts require disclosure of litigation funding arrangements, meaning judges, opposing parties, and the public may not know that a third party with its own financial interests is directing or influencing litigation strategy. [Observed] The result is a growing shadow influence system where financial actors can use the courts to advance policy objectives — challenging regulations, funding patent troll operations, or sustaining class actions — without the transparency requirements that apply to lobbying, campaign spending, or other forms of political participation. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Third-party litigation funders invest in lawsuits for financial return, shaping litigation strategy and legal precedent without disclosure requirements that would reveal the financial interests driving the case. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Litigation finance funds** (Burford Capital, Longford Capital, Bentham IMF, hedge fund litigation desks) — provide capital to plaintiffs or law firms in exchange for a percentage of litigation proceeds. [Observed] Incentive: maximize return on invested capital by selecting and influencing high-value cases. Constraint: limited regulatory oversight; reputational risk if funding arrangements become public. [Observed]
- **Plaintiffs' attorneys** — receive funding that allows them to pursue cases they could not finance independently; may cede some degree of litigation strategy control to funders. [Observed] Constraint: ethical rules on attorney independence vary by jurisdiction. [Observed]
- **Plaintiffs** — gain access to legal representation and litigation resources through third-party funding; may receive a smaller share of recovery due to funder's interest. [Observed]
- **Defendants** (corporations, government agencies) — face litigation that may be sustained longer or pursued more aggressively due to third-party funding; may not know that a funder is involved. [Observed]
- **Federal and state courts** — adjudicate funded cases without systematic knowledge of funding arrangements; some courts have issued disclosure orders, but no uniform rule exists. [Observed]
- **Regulatory agencies** — may face litigation challenges to regulations funded by entities with financial interests in the regulatory outcome. [Inferred]
- **Congress and state legislatures** — have considered but not enacted comprehensive litigation finance disclosure or regulation. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A litigation finance fund evaluates a potential case based on expected damages, litigation costs, probability of success, and time to resolution. [Observed]
- The funder and the plaintiff or plaintiff's attorney negotiate a funding agreement specifying capital provided, funder's share of recovery, and degree of funder involvement in litigation strategy. [Observed]
- The funded litigation proceeds through the judicial system; the funder may participate in strategy decisions including settlement negotiations, expert selection, and litigation timing. [Inferred]
- The opposing party and the court may not know that a funder is involved, as no uniform disclosure requirement exists. [Observed]
- If the litigation succeeds, the funder receives its contractual share of the recovery; if it fails, the funder absorbs the loss. [Observed]
- Litigation outcomes — especially appellate decisions and regulatory challenges — may establish legal precedent that affects the funder's broader portfolio of investments. [Inferred]
- The absence of disclosure means the public cannot evaluate whether patterns of litigation reflect authentic grievances or strategically funded campaigns. [Inferred]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Litigation funders select which cases receive financial support, acting as de facto gatekeepers to the judicial system for high-cost litigation. [Inferred]
- **Bottlenecks:** The concentration of litigation finance capital in a small number of funds means these entities can systematically shape litigation patterns in particular industries or regulatory areas. [Inferred]
- **Veto points:** No regulatory body has authority over litigation funding arrangements; disclosure depends on individual court orders. [Observed]

### Common failure modes

- Funders may prioritize cases with high financial returns over cases with strong legal merit, distorting the litigation landscape toward damages-rich claims. [Inferred]
- Patent assertion entities ("patent trolls") use litigation finance to sustain infringement campaigns that impose settlement pressure on defendants who cannot justify the cost of litigation. [Observed]
- Regulatory litigation funded by entities with financial interests in the regulatory outcome may appear as public interest litigation while advancing private commercial objectives. [Inferred]
- The absence of disclosure prevents judges from identifying potential conflicts of interest, including cases where the funder has interests in other pending matters before the same court. [Inferred]
- Funded litigation may be sustained beyond the point where settlement would serve the plaintiff's interest, because the funder's portfolio-level incentives differ from the individual plaintiff's case-level interests. [Inferred]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze litigation patterns in patent, mass tort, and regulatory cases to test whether funder involvement correlates with case duration, settlement patterns, or outcome distributions. [Inferred]
- Track litigation funding disclosures in jurisdictions where courts have ordered them to measure the accuracy of the non-disclosure concern. [Observed]
- Compare case selection patterns of funded versus unfunded litigation to test whether funders select for damages potential over legal merit. [Hypothesis]
- Map litigation finance fund portfolios to identify cases where funders have systematic interests in particular regulatory or precedent outcomes. [Inferred]
- Analyze the growth of litigation finance industry assets under management over time. [Observed]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the litigation finance industry — fund structure, case selection, funding agreements, and the funder's role in litigation strategy. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain how financial return incentives create a litigation market where case selection, strategy, and settlement decisions are influenced by investors rather than plaintiffs. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific funded litigation campaign (patent enforcement, regulatory challenge, or mass tort) showing the funder's role, the non-disclosure dynamic, and the policy impact. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present industry AUM data, disclosure patterns, patent troll funding analysis, and regulatory litigation funding networks. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate mandatory disclosure of funding arrangements, judicial disclosure rules, funder fiduciary duties to plaintiffs, and regulatory oversight of litigation finance. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** Litigation finance creates a shadow system where financial actors can use the courts to advance policy objectives without the transparency requirements that apply to every other form of political participation. [Inferred]
