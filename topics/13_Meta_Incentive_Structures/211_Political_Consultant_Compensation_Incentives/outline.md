# Political Consultant Compensation Incentives

**Summary:** Political consulting firms — campaign strategists, media buyers, pollsters, and fundraising consultants — are compensated through structures that create incentives misaligned with the candidates and causes they serve: media buyers earn commissions on advertising spend (incentivizing higher spend rather than effective placement), fundraising consultants take percentage cuts of donations raised (incentivizing high-volume small-dollar solicitation regardless of donor fatigue or list degradation), and campaign managers earn bonuses tied to win margins rather than policy outcomes. [Observed] The political consulting industry generates billions per election cycle with minimal disclosure of fee structures, subcontractor relationships, or performance metrics, creating an information asymmetry where candidates and donors cannot evaluate whether consulting spend produces proportional results. [Observed] Because consultants move between campaigns, party committees, and super PACs, their long-term financial incentives favor maintaining relationships within the political ecosystem over maximizing any single client's outcome. [Inferred] The structural effect is a professional class whose compensation architecture rewards spending volume and relationship maintenance over measurable electoral or policy impact. [Inferred]

**Mechanism in one sentence:** Political consultants are compensated through commission and percentage structures that reward spending volume and relationship maintenance rather than measurable client outcomes. [Inferred]

### Actors and roles

- **Media buying firms** — purchase television, digital, and radio advertising on behalf of campaigns and PACs; earn commissions (typically 10-15%) on total ad spend. [Observed] Incentive: maximize total media buy volume. Constraint: FEC requires disclosure of payments to media firms, but commission structures within those payments are not itemized. [Observed]
- **Fundraising consultants** — design and execute direct mail, email, and digital fundraising programs; compensated through percentage of funds raised (typically 10-20% for direct mail, 5-15% for digital). [Observed] Incentive: maximize donation volume regardless of donor retention or list quality. [Inferred]
- **Campaign strategists / general consultants** — provide overall campaign strategy, messaging, and coordination; compensated through monthly retainers plus performance bonuses. [Observed] Incentive: win elections to build reputation for future client acquisition. Constraint: performance metrics are binary (win/lose) and don't distinguish consultant contribution from structural factors. [Inferred]
- **Pollsters** — conduct survey research and focus groups; compensated per poll or on retainer. [Observed] Incentive: produce results that confirm client strategy (confirmation bias in research design). [Inferred]
- **Candidates and campaign committees** — hire consultants and pay fees from campaign funds; face information asymmetry about consultant fee structures and performance. [Observed]
- **Donors** — fund campaigns and PACs whose spending goes substantially to consulting fees; have limited visibility into what percentage of donations reach voters versus consultants. [Observed]
- **FEC** — requires disclosure of campaign expenditures but not the internal fee structures or commission rates within vendor payments. [Observed]

### Process map (bulleted)

- A candidate or committee selects consultants, typically through personal networks, party recommendations, or prior working relationships rather than competitive bidding. [Observed]
- Consultants and the campaign negotiate fee structures: retainers, commissions, percentage-of-raise, or hybrid models; these agreements are not publicly disclosed. [Observed]
- Media buyers place ad buys and earn commissions embedded in the total spend reported to the FEC; the commission is not separately itemized in FEC filings. [Observed]
- Fundraising consultants execute solicitation programs; their percentage take is deducted before net proceeds are reported, obscuring the cost-of-fundraising ratio for individual programs. [Observed]
- Consultants may subcontract work to affiliated firms (often owned by the same principals), creating layers of fees that compound the total cost without transparent disclosure. [Inferred]
- Campaign treasury reports to the FEC show gross expenditures by vendor but do not disaggregate consulting fees, commissions, production costs, and pass-through media purchases. [Observed]
- After the election, successful consultants leverage wins for future business; unsuccessful consultants may still earn substantial fees from the losing campaign. [Observed]

### Where power concentrates

- **Gatekeepers:** Party committees and senior operatives recommend consultants to campaigns, creating an insider network where access to clients depends on relationships rather than demonstrated performance. [Inferred]
- **Bottlenecks:** Media buying is concentrated among a small number of firms that handle the majority of political advertising spend, giving these firms disproportionate influence over campaign resource allocation. [Observed]
- **Veto points:** Candidates who challenge consultant fee structures risk losing access to preferred vendors and the institutional knowledge they carry. [Inferred]

### Common failure modes

- Commission-based media buying incentivizes television advertising over potentially more cost-effective digital, field, or direct voter contact programs. [Inferred]
- Fundraising consultants who earn percentage-of-raise have incentives to use aggressive solicitation tactics that maximize short-term revenue but degrade donor lists and generate donor fatigue. [Observed]
- The lack of standardized performance metrics means consultants can attribute wins to their strategy and attribute losses to external factors without accountability. [Inferred]
- Subcontracting to affiliated firms creates undisclosed fee stacking where multiple entities controlled by the same individuals each take a cut of campaign spending. [Observed]
- Post-election financial reports show total spending by vendor but not the efficiency of that spending, preventing systematic evaluation of consultant value. [Observed]

### What evidence would prove/disprove key claims

- Analyze FEC disbursement data to calculate the percentage of total campaign spending that goes to consulting fees versus direct voter contact. [Observed]
- Compare advertising placement efficiency (cost-per-impression, cost-per-vote) between campaigns using commission-based versus flat-fee media buying. [Hypothesis]
- Track consultant career patterns to test whether win records predict future hiring or whether network connections are the stronger predictor. [Inferred]
- Obtain and compare consulting fee agreements (via FOIA for government-related committees or campaign disclosures) across campaigns to measure fee structure variation. [Inferred]
- Measure donor retention rates for campaigns using percentage-based fundraising consultants versus flat-fee models. [Hypothesis]

### Episode outline (6 parts)

1. **Structure:** Map the political consulting industry's compensation architecture — commissions, percentage-of-raise, retainers, and subcontracting layers. [Observed]
2. **Incentive:** Explain why commission and percentage structures create misaligned incentives that reward spending volume over spending effectiveness. [Inferred]
3. **Example:** Trace a specific campaign's consulting expenditures, showing how much of total spending went to consulting fees versus direct voter contact. [Observed]
4. **Evidence:** Present data on consulting industry revenue, commission rates, media buying concentration, and the percentage of campaign funds consumed by consulting fees. [Observed]
5. **Levers:** Evaluate mandatory fee disclosure, competitive bidding requirements for party-funded campaigns, flat-fee models, and performance-based compensation structures. [Hypothesis]
6. **Takeaway:** The political consulting industry's compensation structure means the people managing campaign resources have financial incentives that diverge from the candidates and donors whose money they spend. [Inferred]
