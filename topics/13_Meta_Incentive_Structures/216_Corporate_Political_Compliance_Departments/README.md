## Key actors
- Corporate government affairs / political compliance teams
- Corporate PACs (employee-funded political contributions)
- In-house and contract lobbyists
- Trade associations (Chamber, NAM, industry groups)
- C-suite and board of directors (political strategy)
- Shareholders (limited political spending visibility)
- FEC and IRS (enforcement)

## Primary statutes and authorities
- Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) (PAC rules)
- Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. §§ 1601–1614)
- Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010)
- SEC Rule 14a-8 (shareholder proposals)

## Case study
- **CPA-Zicklin Index and corporate political spending transparency**: The Center for Political Accountability tracks how S&P 500 companies disclose their political spending; analysis reveals that most companies still disclose significant political spending only through trade associations where corporate attribution is obscured.

## Data sources
- CPA-Zicklin Index of corporate political spending transparency
- OpenSecrets corporate PAC and lobbying data
- Conference Board corporate political activity surveys
- SEC shareholder proposal filings on political spending
