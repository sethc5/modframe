# FAQ

## Is this partisan?

The goal is neutral, institutional explanations of financial-system mechanisms and incentives. People can disagree about values and policy while still agreeing on how markets and regulators work.

## Does this name individuals?

Modules focus on structures. Individuals may appear only as illustrative examples with citations, and the mechanism should remain the focus.

## What's the difference between this and "explainer journalism"?

This is designed as a reusable library of modules that can be recombined whenever financial events occur, so coverage can shift from episodic outrage to pattern recognition of how Wall Street power mechanics actually function.
