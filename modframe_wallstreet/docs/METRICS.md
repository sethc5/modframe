# Metrics (Draft)

This project's aim is *leverage through shared structural understanding*, not attention alone.

## Adoption / reuse

- Citations in financial journalism, research, and educational materials
- Reuse of diagrams/modules by third parties (attribution trails)
- Translations and forks

## Quality

- % modules with primary sources
- Time-to-update for major structural changes
- Review coverage (draft vs reviewed)

## Impact signals

- Evidence that modules change how financial stories are framed (structure-first language)
- Evidence that readers can identify mechanisms and propose realistic accountability levers
