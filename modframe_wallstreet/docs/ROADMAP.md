# Roadmap (Draft)

## Phase 0 — Skeleton

- Confirm section taxonomy for financial-system power mechanics
- Standardize module template

## Phase 1 — Core coverage

- Build out a first tranche of high-leverage modules per section (market structure, regulation, systemic risk, etc.)
- Add visuals for mechanisms that benefit from diagrams

## Phase 2 — Activation workflows

- Provide "activation packs" for financial crises and market events (which modules to pull, what evidence to request, what visuals to show)

## Phase 3 — External adoption

- Outreach to financial journalists, researchers, educators, and regulators
- Encourage reuse under CC BY 4.0
