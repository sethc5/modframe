# Project Charter

## Purpose

Map and explain major levers of financial-system power in Wall Street and adjacent markets as a modular, free-to-use, citation-forward library.

## Operating posture

- Nonpartisan / cross-ideological usability
- Institutional tone
- Explicit claim types and sourcing

## Deliverable

A skeletal topic map (`topics/`) + topic modules that can be "activated" for current events coverage of Wall Street power mechanics.

## Why it matters

Awareness of mechanics is a precursor to accountability. When financial systems produce outcomes that are unjust to the public, clarity about *where* and *how* power is exercised enables targeted scrutiny and pressure.
