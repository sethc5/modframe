# Activation Playbook (Draft)

An "activation" is a repeatable way to cover a current financial event or crisis by pulling in the relevant structural modules.

## Steps

1. Identify which lever(s) the event touches (map event → modules)
2. Pull the module's process map and failure modes
3. Gather evidence (documents/data) listed in the module
4. Produce a structure-first segment:
   - explain the mechanism
   - show where discretion/gatekeeping occurs
   - show what evidence indicates
   - list accountability levers

## Output formats

- 5–8 minute segment outline
- one-page brief
- diagram pack
