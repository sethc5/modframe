## Summary Prompt

I want to explore building a modular, evergreen financial-system power framework called (working title) "modframe_wallstreet."

Core idea:

Create a publicly hosted, open-concept library of neutral, institutional explainers about how financial-system power structures actually function (market structure, regulatory architecture, clearing and settlement, systemic risk, executive compensation, derivatives markets, etc.). These would be evergreen, citation-heavy, visually modular, and platform-neutral.

When financial crises, market disruptions, or major regulatory events arise, media outlets (or the project itself) can "activate" the relevant structural framework and layer in the current event — shifting coverage from reactive outrage to systemic pattern recognition.

The long-term goal is not to tailor this to any one personality or network, but to:

1. Establish widely adopted structural language and frameworks for financial-system power.
2. Become a reference standard for financial journalists and analysts.
3. Increase leverage by defining how financial-system dysfunction is measured and discussed.
4. Potentially evolve into a cross-ideological accountability infrastructure for Wall Street.

Key questions to explore:

- How should the concept be framed to be irresistible to financial media outlets?
- What would the minimum viable version look like?
- How do we prevent ideological capture while maintaining clarity?
- What's the optimal sequencing from launch to influence?
- What structural governance would preserve legitimacy?
- What metrics would indicate real leverage vs. superficial traction?

I want rigorous strategic analysis — not surface-level media advice.
