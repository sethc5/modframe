# Visuals Guide (Draft)

Preferred visuals are structural: flowcharts, timelines, org charts, decision trees.

## Good candidates

- capital flow pathways
- regulatory and enforcement chains
- market structure diagrams (order routing, clearing, settlement)
- veto points and gatekeeping mechanisms

## File layout

Place visuals under a module's `figures/` folder and reference them from `README.md` / `outline.md`.
