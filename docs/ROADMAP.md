# Roadmap (Draft)

## Phase 0 — Skeleton

- Confirm section taxonomy (01–23)
- Standardize module template

## Phase 1 — Core coverage

- Build out a first tranche of high-leverage modules per section
- Add visuals for mechanisms that benefit from diagrams

## Phase 2 — Activation workflows

- Provide “activation packs” for breaking events (which modules to pull, what evidence to request, what visuals to show)

## Phase 3 — External adoption

- Outreach to educators, newsrooms, and researchers
- Encourage reuse under CC BY 4.0
