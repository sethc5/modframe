# Governance (Draft)

Goal: keep the library broadly trusted and difficult to capture ideologically.

## Editorial principles

- Structural mechanics first.
- Prefer primary sources.
- Make uncertainty explicit.

## Change control

- Major structural changes (taxonomy, naming, numbering) should be proposed in a PR with rationale.
- Modules can be iterated continuously, but should retain a clear changelog note in the PR description.

## Conflicts of interest

Contributors should disclose relevant conflicts (employment, lobbying, financial ties) when working on modules where it matters.
