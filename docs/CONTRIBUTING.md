# Contributing

This project aims to be usable by people across the political spectrum. Contributions should help readers understand *mechanics and incentives*.

## Ground rules

- Use an institutional, neutral tone.
- Prefer verifiable claims. When uncertain, state uncertainty explicitly and point to what evidence would resolve it.
- Avoid partisan framing, rhetoric, or activist language in the module text.

## Adding or improving a topic module

A topic module lives under `topics/<section>/<topic>/` and should include:

- `README.md` — purpose, status, tags, and contribution notes
- `outline.md` — structured outline and source targets
- optional `figures/` — visuals and charts referenced from README/outline

Use `docs/MODULE_TEMPLATE.md` as the canonical structure.

## Sourcing expectations

- Prefer: statutes, regulations, court opinions, agency guidance, GAO/OIG reports, official data, and reputable primary reporting.
- Keep citations specific (document title, date, issuing body, and link).

## Review checklist (PR)

- [ ] Neutral tone maintained
- [ ] Key claims have citations or are labeled as hypotheses
- [ ] Definitions match `docs/GLOSSARY.md` (or glossary updated)
- [ ] Module structure matches `docs/MODULE_TEMPLATE.md`
