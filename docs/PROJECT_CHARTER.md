# Project Charter

## Purpose

A structural and mechanical map of how Washington DC federal government power actually works — where it concentrates, what incentives drive behavior, and what structural features enable or prevent accountability.

14 core sections, 230 modules. 147 built with deep content, citations, and actor analysis. 83 scaffold modules awaiting build.

## Operating posture

- Nonpartisan / cross-ideological usability
- Institutional tone
- Explicit claim types: `[Observed]`, `[Inferred]`, `[Hypothesis]`
- Primary sources first (statutes, agency records, court opinions, GAO/OIG reports)

## Deliverable

A modular topic library (`topics/`) where each module explains one mechanism of federal power — standalone and composable for "activation" coverage of current events.

## Scope

- **Core (sections 01–14):** Structural mechanics of DC federal power — elections, Congress, executive branch, judiciary, influence, media, states, money, crisis governance, polarization, accountability, foreign influence, meta-incentives, emerging structures
- **Future expansion:** 45 domain-applied federal power sections + 19 financial system deep-dive sections (~380 module ideas)

## Why it matters

Awareness of mechanics is a precursor to accountability. When systems produce outcomes that are unjust to the public, clarity about *where* and *how* power is exercised enables targeted scrutiny and pressure.
